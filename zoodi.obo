namespace: dbpedia
def: "The Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MLV or A-MuLV) is a retrovirus (Class VI) used to induce transformation of murine lymphoid cells. As a retrovirus, it has a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome which replicates via a DNA intermediate mediated by a reverse transcriptase. The Abelson murine leukemia virus is named for the American pediatrician Herbert T. Abelson, who first described and isolated it.A-MuLV causes a rapidly progressive lymphosarcoma known as Abelson disease in mice, which is a type of leukemia that does not involve the thymus. However, this is only possible when the host cell is co-infected with a helper virus which provides functions it needs to be able to replicate which it does not code for in its own genome such as a reverse transcriptase and some major structural proteins. As such, A-MuLV can be described as a dependovirus. A highly efficient helper virus commonly used when growing A-MuLV in vitro is Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV). It causes leukemia directly by interfering with the normal growth and differentiation processes of lymphocytes. It can infect B-cells which was shown by the fact that some tumor cells can be seen to have immunoglobulins (Ig) on their surface although most tumor cells do not have characteristic receptors on their surface indicating that they are undifferentiated cells. In vitro studies have shown that lymphocyte infection produces tumor cell populations comprising three types of cells: stable productive cells, non-productive cells and cells which produced defective virus particles which are not infective."

ASFV infects domestic pigs, warthogs and bushpigs, as well as soft ticks (Ornithodoros), which likely act as a vector.ASFV is the only virus with a double-stranded DNA genome transmitted by arthropods. The virus causes a lethal haemorraghic disease in domestic pigs. Some isolates can cause death of animals within as quickly as a week after infection. In all other species, the virus causes no obvious disease. ASFV is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between ticks and wild pigs, bushpigs, and warthogs. The disease was first described after European settlers brought pigs into areas endemic with ASFV and, as such, is an example of an 'emerging infection'." [Wikipedia:African_swine_fever_virus]

Bacterial pyoderma, dermatophytosis, and parasites can also cause the condition. In rabbits, dermatophytosis is a prime cause of alopecia in young, newly weaned specimens. Dermatophytosis as a cause of alopecia is common in cats, too, and in long-haired varieties, dermatophytic pseudomycetomas may be to blame. Alopecia areata has been studied on mice in laboratories.

def: "Angel wing also known as airplane wing, slipped wing, crooked wing, and drooped wing is a syndrome that affects primarily aquatic birds, such as geese and ducks, in which the last joint of the wing is twisted with the wing feathers pointing out laterally, instead of lying against the body. Males develop it more frequently than females. It has also been reported in goshawks, bustard chicks and psittacine birds (budgerigars, macaws, and conures).The syndrome manifests as an incurable anatomical condition which is acquired in young birds. Due to a high-calorie diet, especially one high in proteins and/or low in vitamin D, vitamin E and manganese, one or both carpus (wrist) joints are retarded in their development relative to the rest of the wing; for reasons unknown, if only one wing is affected it is usually the left one. The result is a wrist which is twisted outwards and unable to perform its usual function. Angel wing symptoms include stripped remiges (flight feathers) in the wrist area, or remiges protruding from wings at odd angles. In extreme cases, the stripped feathers may resemble sickly blue straw protruding from wings. In adult birds the disease is incurable and usually leads to an early death as affected birds are rendered effectively or totally flightless. In young birds wrapping the wing and binding it against the bird's flank, together with feeding the bird a more natural diet, can reverse the damage.The only wild waterfowl populations known to be affected are those fed by man.[citation needed] In Sweden, ten different park populations of Canada geese produced angel wing. The following year one flock was not fed any artificial feed and there were no angel wing goslings produced.[citation needed]The theorized cause of angel wing is the excessive intake of carbohydrates and proteins, together with insufficient intake of vitamin E, low dietary calcium and manganese deficiency. Angel wing is frequently observed in waterfowl residing near humans, and the disease can often be observed in areas where geese or ducks are excessively fed bread (especially white bread). To prevent angel wing, waterfowl should not be fed white bread, popcorn or other human foodstuffs. Duck seed is an alternative for duck feeders." [Wikipedia:Angel_wing]

ARGT was first recorded in vicinity of Black Springs, South Australia, in the 1950s and then near Gnowangerup, Western Australia, in the 1960s. The disease has spread rapidly and approximately 40,000 to 60,000 square kilometres of farmland in Western Australia, and similar areas in South Australia are now infested by the ARGT-causing organisms. Most ARGT-related livestock losses occur during October to January, but losses have been recorded as late as April. Herbicide applications aimed to reduce ryegrass population have been successful in reducing the risk of ARGT but have undesirable effects such as rapid reduction in pasture productivity and increase in ryegrass herbicide resistance.A recently released biological control agent, the twist fungus, has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the risk ARGT without the need of controlling ryegrass.

namespace: dbpedia
def: "Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects both humans and animals. There are now effective vaccines against anthrax, and some forms of the disease respond well to antibiotic treatment.Like many other members of the genus Bacillus, Bacillus anthracis can form dormant endospores (often referred to as \"spores\" for short, but not to be confused with fungal spores) that are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries. Such spores can be found on all continents, even Antarctica. When spores are inhaled, ingested, or come into contact with a skin lesion on a host, they may become reactivated and multiply rapidly.Anthrax commonly infects wild and domesticated herbivorous mammals that ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Ingestion is thought to be the most common route by which herbivores contract anthrax. Carnivores living in the same environment may become infected by consuming infected animals. Diseased animals can spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact (e.g., inoculation of infected blood to broken skin) or by consumption of a diseased animal's flesh.Anthrax does not spread directly from one infected animal or person to another; it is spread by spores. These spores can be transported by clothing or shoes. The body of an animal that had active anthrax at the time of death can also be a source of anthrax spores. Owing to the hardiness of anthrax spores, and their ease of production in vitro, they are extraordinarily well suited to use (in powdered and aerosol form) as biological weapons. Such weaponization has been accomplished in the past by at least five state bio-weapons programs — those of the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, Russia and Iraq — and has been attempted by several others.Until the twentieth century, anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of animals and people worldwide each year. French scientist Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine for anthrax in 1881. Thanks to over a century of animal vaccination programs, sterilization of raw animal waste materials, and anthrax eradication programs in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Europe, and parts of Africa and Asia, anthrax infection is now relatively rare in domestic animals (with only a few dozen cases reported each year).[citation needed] Anthrax is especially rare in dogs and cats, as is evidenced by a single reported case in the USA in 2001.Anthrax typically does not cause disease in carnivores and scavengers, even when these animals consume anthrax-infected carcasses, but can occur in this manner. Anthrax outbreaks do occur in some wild animal populations with some regularity.The disease is more common in countries without widespread veterinary or human public health programs. In the 21st century, anthrax is still a problem in less developed countries. An outbreak of anthrax in humans who had eaten meat from a dead carabao was reported in Cagayan province in the Philippines in early 2010, with over 400 cases of illness and at least two fatalities.Bacillus anthracis bacterial spores are soil-borne. Because of their long lifespan, spores are present globally and remain at the burial sites of animals killed by anthrax for many decades. Disturbed grave sites of infected animals have caused reinfection over 70 years after the animal's interment." [Wikipedia:Anthrax]

This kind of operation is best done by a veterinarian. If the tumor is inflammatory, one resorts to an oil of pompillion, an ointment made of buds of black poplar, lard and sheets of poppy, belladonna, etc. If it has formed an abscess, one first applies a soft poultice.In pre-modern medicine, this was thought to be caused by a sanguine and bilious humour. The disease has also been erroneously attributed to the heart, whence it was called by Jacques de Solleysell a swelling of the pericardium, whereas it is really an inflammation in the gullet and throat.In humans, this is called Ludwig's angina, or squinancy."

Some forms are intertwined; for example ABPA and simple aspergilloma can progress to CPA.Other, non-invasive manifestations include fungal sinusitis (both allergic in nature and with established fungal balls), otomycosis (ear infection), keratitis (eye infection) and onychomycosis (nail infection). In most instances these are less severe, and curable with effective antifungal treatment.People with deficient immune systems—such as patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, chemotherapy for leukaemia, or AIDS—are at risk of more disseminated disease. Acute invasive aspergillosis occurs when the immune system fails to prevent Aspergillus spores from entering the bloodstream via the lungs. Without the body mounting an effective immune response, fungal cells are free to disseminate throughout the body and can infect major organs such as the heart and kidneys.The most frequently identified pathogen is Aspergillus fumigatus—a ubiquitous organism that is capable of living under extensive environmental stress. It is estimated that most humans inhale thousands of Aspergillus spores daily, but they do not impact on most people’s health due to effective immune responses. Taken together, the major chronic, invasive and allergic forms of aspergillosis account for around 600,000 deaths annually worldwide." [Wikipedia:Aspergillosis]

def: "Asteroid hyalosis is a degenerative condition of the eye involving small white opacities in the vitreous humor. It is known to occur in humans, dogs, cats and chinchillas. Clinically, these opacities are quite refractile, giving the appearance of stars (or asteroids) shining in the night sky—except that ocular asteroids are often quite mobile. Ocular asteroids must be distinguished from the more common typical vitreous floaters, which are usually fibrillar or cellular condensates. The cause of asteroid hyalosis is unknown, but it has been associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and, in certain animals, tumors of the ciliary body. In dogs, asteroid hyalosis is considered to be an age related change. The asteroid bodies are made up of hydroxylapatite, which in turn consists of calcium and phosphates or phospholipids. While asteroid hyalosis does not usually severely affect vision, the floating opacities can be quite annoying, and may interfere significantly with visualization and testing of the retina. While treatment of asteroid hyalosis is usually unnecessary, vitrectomy may occasionally be indicated, for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes." [Wikipedia:Asteroid_hyalosis]

Approximately 50% of people with this disease will develop end stage kidney disease and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. Progression to end stage kidney disease usually happens in the 4th to 6th decades of life. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease occurs worldwide and affects about 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 people.Defects in two genes are thought to be responsible for ADPKD. In 85% of patients, ADPKD is caused by mutations in the gene PKD1 on chromosome 16 (TRPP1); in 15% of patients mutations in PKD2 (TRPP2) are causative.Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a distinct disease that also leads to cysts in the kidneys and liver, typically presents in childhood, only affects about 1 in 20,000 people and has different causes and prognosis."

def: "Avian influenza — known informally as avian flu or bird flu — refers to \"influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds.\" The version with the greatest concern is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).\"Bird flu\" is a phrase similar to \"swine flu,\" \"dog flu,\" \"horse flu,\" or \"human flu\" in that it refers to an illness caused by any of many different strains of influenza viruses that have adapted to a specific host. All known viruses that cause influenza in birds belong to the species influenza A virus. All subtypes (but not all strains of all subtypes) of influenza A virus are adapted to birds, which is why for many purposes avian flu virus is the influenza A virus. (Note, however, that the \"A\" does not stand for \"avian\").Adaptation is not exclusive. Being adapted toward a particular species does not preclude adaptations, or partial adaptations, toward infecting different species. In this way, strains of influenza viruses are adapted to multiple species, though may be preferential toward a particular host. For example, viruses responsible for influenza pandemics are adapted to both humans and birds. Recent influenza research into the genes of the Spanish flu virus shows it to have genes adapted to both birds and humans, with more of its genes from birds than less deadly later pandemic strains.While its most highly pathogenic strain (H5N1) had been spreading throughout Asia since 2003, avian influenza reached Europe in 2005, and the Middle East, as well as Africa, the following year. On January 22, 2012, China reported its second human death due to bird flu in a month following other fatalities in Vietnam and Cambodia. Companion birds in captivity and parrots are highly unlikely to contract the virus, and there has been no report of a companion bird with avian influenza since 2003. Pigeons do not contract or spread the virus. 84% of affected bird populations are composed of chicken and farm birds, while the 15% is madeup of wild birds according to capture-and-release operations in the 2000s, during the SARs pandemic. The first deadly Canadian case was confirmed on January 3, 2014." [Wikipedia:Avian_influenza]

Poxviruses have generally large genomes, and other such examples include smallpox and monkeypox. Members of the avipoxvirus genus infect specifically birds. Avipoxviruses are unable to complete their replication cycle in non avian species. Although it is comparably slow-spreading, Avipoxvirus is known to cause symptoms like pustules full of pus lining the skin and diphtheria-like symptoms. These diphtheria-like symptoms might include dipitheric necrotic membranes lining the mouth and the upper respiratory tract. This disease can be transmitted to humans by unusually close contact with birds that are infected or the consuming of liquids or solids that have been in extremely close contact with an infected bird. Like other avian viruses, it can be transmitted through vectors mechanically such as through mosquitoes.Avipoxvirus is a virus that is brick shaped and is usually 200 nanometers in diameter. This is much larger than normal viruses which are around 60 nanometers in diameter. This virus can only be contracted through vectors and consumption of infected items, but they can be filtered by a special water filter. This filter is called a Large Volume Water Sampler (LVWS).Unlike other viruses, avipoxvirus can withstand extreme dryness. With this advantage, it can spread on dust particles. This is because it has adapted to living in the dry mucous membranes of an infected host's upper respiratory tract.As this virus is a poxvirus, it has a high mortality rate in birds, as other poxviruses have in humans. The effects of this virus might increase the difficulty of breathing, eating, and drinking significantly. Exterior lesions are restricted to the non-feathered parts of the body, usually the face and legs and are characterized by proliferative and necrotizing dermatitis. Another feature of this bird pox that has been observed is the presence of blood sacs or blisters filled with bloody fluid that will collapse when pierced with a needled and allowed to drain.This virus has the highest mortality rate in upland gamebirds such as pheasant, quail, and chukar, as well as in songbirds, marine birds such as seagulls, parrots, and some raptors such as the peregrine falcon.Other names for this peculiar virus might include avian pox, fowlpox, canarypox, juncopox, mynahpox."

A characteristic symptom of the infection is the development of cyanotic (bluish) discoloration on the head, giving rise to the common name of the disease, \"blackhead\".Poultry (especially free-ranging) and wild birds commonly harbor a number of parasitic worms with only mild health problems from them. Turkeys are much more susceptible to getting blackhead than are chickens. Thus, chickens can be infected carriers for a long time because they are not removed or medicated by their owners, and they do not die or stop eating/defecating. H. gallinarum eggs can remain infective in soil for four years, a high risk of transmitting blackhead to turkeys remains if they graze areas with chicken feces in this time frame.The most common symptom of blackhead disease is yellow, watery bird droppings. To reduce the spreading of the disease, sick birds must be removed and their litter changed." [Wikipedia:Blackhead_disease]

It was thought to occur \"by great chafing, and heating of the Stomach\".Blain is also mentioned in Cattle: Their Breeds, Management, and Diseases, published in 1836, where it is also identified as \"gloss-anthrax\". W. C. Spooner's 1888 book The History, Structure, Economy and Diseases of the Sheep also identifies blain as being the same as gloss-anthrax.Modern scholarship suggests that \"gloss-anthrax\" was not the same disease as modern-day anthrax, but instead could have been foot-and-mouth disease, or a viral infection with a secondary Fusobacterium necrophorum infection. It has also been suggested that it may have been due to a variant strain of true anthrax that is no longer in existence. Other sources also report epizootics known as \"blain\" or \"black-blain\" in the 13th and 14th centuries, but it is not clear if the disease involved was the same as \"gloss-anthrax\"."

The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking.This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever.Botulism can occur in a few different ways. The bacterial spores that cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin are eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases toxin. Typically this only happens in children less than six months of age as after that protective mechanisms develop. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation spores enter a wound and, in the absence of oxygen, release toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question.Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin is destroyed by heating to more than 85 °C (185 °F) for greater than 5 minutes. Avoiding giving children less than one year of age honey is also recommended. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation potentially for months may be required. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect a number of other animals." [Wikipedia:Botulism]

def: "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease (encephalopathy) in cattle that causes a spongy degeneration in the brain and spinal cord. BSE has a long incubation period, about 30 months to 8 years, usually affecting adult cattle at a peak age onset of four to five years, all breeds being equally susceptible. In the United Kingdom, the country worst affected, more than 180,000 cattle have been infected and 4.4 million slaughtered during the eradication program.The disease may be most easily transmitted to human beings by eating food contaminated with the brain, spinal cord or digestive tract of infected carcasses. However, the infectious agent, although most highly concentrated in nervous tissue, can be found in virtually all tissues throughout the body, including blood. In humans, it is known as new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD or nvCJD), and by October 2009, it had killed 166 people in the United Kingdom, and 44 elsewhere. Between 460,000 and 482,000 BSE-infected animals had entered the human food chain before controls on high-risk offal were introduced in 1989.A British and Irish inquiry into BSE concluded the epizootic was caused by cattle, which are normally herbivores, being fed the remains of other cattle in the form of meat and bone meal (MBM), which caused the infectious agent to spread. The cause of BSE may be from the contamination of MBM from sheep with scrapie that were processed in the same slaughterhouse. The epidemic was probably accelerated by the recycling of infected bovine tissues prior to the recognition of BSE. The origin of the disease itself remains unknown. The infectious agent is distinctive for the high temperatures at which it remains viable, over 600 degrees Celsius (about 1100 degrees Fahrenheit). This contributed to the spread of the disease in the United Kingdom, which had reduced the temperatures used during its rendering process. Another contributory factor was the feeding of infected protein supplements to very young calves." [Wikipedia:Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy]

Because all of these components make it more difficult to breathe, in situations of exercise, stress, or heat, an animal with these abnormalities may be unable to take deep or fast enough breaths to blow off carbon dioxide. This leads to distress and further increases respiratory rate and heart rate, creating a vicious circle that can quickly lead to a life-threatening situation.Dogs experiencing a crisis situation due to brachycephalic syndrome typically benefit from oxygen, cool temperatures, sedatives, and in some cases more advance medical intervention including intubation."

Bacteria B. canis are rod-shaped or cocci, oxidase, catalase, and urease positive. The species was firstly described in USA in 1966 where mass abortions of beagles were documented. The disease is characterized by epididymitis and orchitis in male dogs, endometritis, placentitis and abortions in females, and often presents as infertility in both sexes. Other symptoms such as inflammation in eyes and axial and appendicular skeleton, lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly, are less common. Humans can be also infected but infections are rare.Brucella canis is a zoonotic organism. Signs of this disease are different in both genders of dogs; females who have Brucella canis face an abortion of their pre-developed fetus. Males face the chance of infertility; the reason is that they develop an antibody against the sperm. This may be followed by inflammation of the testes which will generally settle down a little while after. Symptoms do not only include testicular inflammation, infertility in males, and abortion in females. Another symptom is the infection of the spinal plates or vertebrae, which is called diskospondylitis. Treatment for B. canis is very difficult to find and often very expensive. The combination of minocycline and streptomycin is thought to be useful, but it is often unaffordable. Tetracycline can be a less expensive substitute for minocycline, but it also lowers the effect of the treatment." [Wikipedia:Brucella_canis]

Without treatment, the bubonic plague kills about two thirds of infected humans within four days.The term bubonic plague is derived from the Greek word βουβών, meaning \"groin.\" Swollen lymph nodes (buboes) especially occur in the armpit and groin in persons suffering from bubonic plague. Bubonic plague was often used synonymously for plague, but it does in fact refer specifically to an infection that enters through the skin and travels through the lymphatics, as is often seen in flea-borne infections.Bubonic plague—along with the septicemic plague and the pneumonic plague, which are the two other manifestations of Y. pestis—is commonly believed to be the cause of the Black Death that swept through Europe in the 14th century and killed an estimated 25 million people, or 30–60% of the European population. Around the Mediterranean Region, summers seemed to be the season when the disease took place. While in Europe, people found the disease most occurring in the autumn. Because the plague killed so many of the working population, wages rose and some historians have seen this as a turning point in European economic development." [Wikipedia:Bubonic_plague]

Although cancer accounts for approximately 50% of feline deaths each year, it can be successfully treated if diagnosed early.While the causes of cancer in cats are unknown, feline leukemia virus is suspected to be a prime contributor. Other factors suspected to increase rates of feline cancer include toxins from the environment, second hand smoking, excessive grooming, or licking parts of the body that have been in contact with an environmental toxin.Cancer can be detected early on by observing for certain signs and symptoms. Common diagnosing methods include physical examination, x-rays, ultrasounds, cytology, blood tests, urine tests, and nuclear scans. Depending on the type of cancer and its level of progress, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy may be utilized to treat for cancer.

The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. This disease not only affects thousands of puppies, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly.

Progressive weakness and incoordination of the rear limbs are often the first signs seen in affected dogs, with progression over time to complete paralysis.

Sequence analysis of the genome suggests it diverged from canids over 6,000 years ago; possibly much earlier. However, the most recent common ancestor of extant tumors is more recent: it probably originated 200 to 2,500 years ago.Canine TVT was initially described by Russian veterinarian M.A. Novinsky (1841–1914) in 1876, when he demonstrated that the tumor could be transplanted from one dog to another by infecting them with tumor cells."

Predatory dinoflagellates can kill their prey by releasing toxins or phagocytize small prey directly.Some predatory algae have evolved extreme survival strategies. For example, Oxyrrhis marina can turn cannibalistic on its own species when no suitable non-self prey is available, and Pfiesteria and related species have been discovered to kill and feed on fish, and since have been (mistakenly) referred to as carnivorous \"algae\" by the media."

It develops when the neurons known as Purkinje cells, located in the cerebellum of the brain, begin to die off. These cells affect balance and coordination. They have a critical role to play in the brain. The Purkinje layer allows communication between the granular and molecular cortical layers in the cerebellum. Put simply, without Purkinje cells, an animal loses its sense of space and distance, making balance and coordination difficult.Abiotrophy means the loss of a vital nutritive factor. The exact cause of cerebellar abiotrophy is not known, but it is thought to be due to an intrinsic metabolic defect.In most cases, the Purkinje neurons begin to die off shortly after the animal is born and the condition is noticeable when the animal is less than six months old, though sometimes the onset of symptoms is gradual and the animal is much older before the owner or caretaker notices a problem.CA cannot be prevented, other than by selective breeding to avoid the gene, and it cannot be cured. Genetic testing can detect carriers. In addition to dogs and horses, there also have been cases of cerebellar abiotrophy in Siamese and Domestic shorthair cats; in Angus, Polled Hereford, Charolais and Holstein Friesian cattle; Merino and Wiltshire sheep; and Yorkshire pigs."

In many species, the third eyelid plays an essential role in vision by supplying oxygen and nutrients to the eye via tear production. Normally, the gland can evert without detachment. Cherry eye results from a defect in the retinaculum which is responsible for anchoring the gland to the periorbita. This defect causes the gland to prolapse and protrude from the eye as a red fleshy mass. Problems arise as sensitive tissue dries out and is subjected to external trauma Exposure of the tissue often results in secondary inflammation, swelling, or infection. If left untreated, this condition can lead to Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) and other complications." [Wikipedia:Cherry_eye]

In 1999 C. psittaci and C. abortus were recognized as distinct species based on differences of pathogenicity and DNA-DNA hybridization.C. abortus is endemic among ruminants and has been associated with abortion in a horse, a rabbit, guinea pigs, mice, pigs and humans. Infected females shed bacteria near the time of ovulation, so C. abortus is transmitted orally and sexually among mammals. All C. abortus strains were isolated or PCR-amplified from placenta or fetal organs after spontaneous abortion. C. abortus infection generally remains inapparent until an animal aborts late in gestation or gives birth to a weak or dead foetus.

def: "Congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CA) is a non-lethal autosomal recessive genetic disorder in cattle. An autosomal recessive defect is a disease caused by the presence of two recessive mutant genes on an autosome. CA is classified as a heritable disorder of connective tissue, specifically a disorder of the endomysium and perimysium. The defect in the muscle connective tissue results in a reduced range of elastic extension. CA is also known as 'Fawn calf syndrome'. CA is predominately associated with Angus cattle, however it has also been detected in other Angus associated breeds such as Murray Greys. CA was first identified in Victoria, Australia in 1998. However, it has now been discovered in many other countries. CA calves are almost always born alive, most being able to walk and suckle on their mother's teat leading to their survival in the early stages, although around 20% of CA calves die soon after birth. Differences in phenotypes are not normally noticeable and the weight of new born CA calves are seen to be normal, this means that CA is not always recognised. CA is caused by a specific error in the DNA. This means it can be passed on from parents to offspring. Any cattle known to carry any category one genetic condition such as CA cannot be registered with cattle societies. The carriers of category 1 defects are all identifiable in the Australian Angus database. CA calves that survive are exposed to joint dislocation and early onset of arthritis. This is a result of their flexible joint laxity. Although CA is not as severe as other genetic diseases in cattle such as Mannosidosis (MA), Arthrogryposis multiplex (AM), CA is nonetheless a cause of calf deaths in herds where prevalence of the CA mutation in the herd is high and carrier sires are still being used.Diagnosis of CA can be made with a physical examination of new born calves. This should be done in the first 24 hours after birth, preferably done by a veterinarian or experienced breeder. Despite the variations between severe and non-severe cases, CA is easily diagnosed in a live new born calf. Both males and females can be affected. The following symptoms are observed: congenital proximal limb contracture, congenital distal limb hyperextension, congenital kyphosis and significant postnatal improvement in these clinical signs as the calf grows and matures. CA is not a difficult diagnosis however it requires careful physical examination of the calf followed by constant observation for improvement. Additional signs are present in the calves CA causes but can be more difficult to identify especially in mild cases. These include abnormal long leg bones resulting in a tall stature, loose jointedness, poor muscling and knee knocking . To prevent cattle being affected by CA, sires should be pedigree analysed to minimise the chance of the mutation. If CA is identified in a herd, other bloodlines which have tested negative for CA should be purchased. Some predominant Angus sires identified with CA are Rambo 465T of JRS, Te Mania Kelp K207, Bon View Bando 598, SAF 598 Bando 5175 and Boyd On Target 1083."

This prompted the United States to establish the Bureau of Animal Industry, set up in 1884 to eradicate the disease, which it succeeded in doing.Louis Willems, a Belgian doctor, began pioneering work in the 1850s on animal inoculation against the disease.The bacteria are widespread in Africa, the Middle East, Southern Europe, as well as parts of Asia. It is an airborne species, and can travel up to several kilometres in the right conditions." [Wikipedia:Contagious_bovine_pleuropneumonia]

It is extremely contagious with very high morbidity and mortality rates, causing an interstitial fibrinous pleuropneumonia in infected goats. Infection is spread by close-contact aerosol, therefore overcrowding and confinement increases disease incidence. Stress factors such as malnutrition and long transport can also predispose animals to disease. Goats are the only species affected, therefore the disease is not a zoonosis. There is no age breed or sex predilection, but clinical signs are often worse in younger animals." [Wikipedia:Contagious_caprine_pleuropneumonia]

def: "Copper deficiency is a very rare hematological and neurological disorder. The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as \"swayback\" The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element copper. Copper is ubiquitous and daily requirement is low making acquired copper deficiency very rare. Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies . The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery, such as gastric bypass surgery, due to malabsorption of copper, or zinc toxicity. On the other hand, Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal.Copper is involved in normalized function of many enzymes, such as cytochrome c oxidase, which is complex IV in mitochondrial electron transport chain, ceruloplasmin, Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and in amine oxidases. These enzyme catalyze reactions for oxidative phosphorylation, iron transportation, antioxidant and free radical scavenging and neutralization, and neurotransmitter synthesis, respectively. A regular diet contains a variable amount of copper, but may provide 5 mg/day, of which only 20-50% is absorbed. The diet of the elderly may contain a lower copper content than the recommended daily intake. Dietary copper can be found in whole grain cereals, legumes, oysters, organ meats (particularly liver), cherries, dark chocolate, fruits, leafy green vegetables, nuts, poultry, prunes, and soybeans products like tofu. The deficiency in copper can cause many hematological manifestations, such as myelodysplasia, anemia, leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and neutropenia (low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that is often called \"the first line of defense\" for the immune system). Copper deficiency has long been known for as a cause of myelodysplasia (when a blood profile has indicators of possible future leukemia development), but it was not until recently in 2001 that copper deficiency was associated with neurological manifestations. Some neurological manifestations can be sensory ataxia (irregular coordination due to proprioceptive loss), spasticity, muscle weakness, and more rarely visual loss due to peripheral neuropathy (damage in the peripheral nerves), myelopathy (disease of the spinal cord), and rarely optic neuropathy."

Cowpox is more commonly found in animals other than bovines, such as rodents. Cowpox is similar to, but much milder than, the highly contagious and often deadly smallpox disease. Its close resemblance to the mild form of smallpox inspired the first smallpox vaccine, created and administered by English physician Edward Jenner.The word “vaccination,” coined by Jenner in 1796[2] , is derived from the Latin root vaccinus, meaning of or from the cow. Once vaccinated, a patient develops antibodies that make him/her immune to cowpox, but they also develop immunity to the smallpox virus, or Variola virus. The cowpox vaccinations and later incarnations proved so successful that in 1980, the World Health Organization announced that smallpox was the first disease to be eradicated by vaccination efforts worldwide. Other orthopox viruses remain prevalent in certain communities, such as the cowpox virus (CPXV) in Europe, vaccinia in Brazil, monkeypox virus, and continue to infect humans." [Wikipedia:Cowpox]

It usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months. Breeds most commonly affected include the West Highland White Terrier, Scottish Terrier, Cairn Terrier, and Boston Terrier. It is rare in large breed dogs, but it has been reported. Symptoms include firm swelling of the jaw, drooling, pain, and difficulty eating. It is an inherited disease, especially in Westies, in which it has been recognized as an autosomal recessive trait. Canine distemper has also been indicated as a possible cause, as has E. coli infection, which could be why it is seen occasionally in large breed dogs. Growth of lesions will usually stop around the age of one year, and possibly regress. This timing coincides with the normal completion of endochondral bone growth and ossification. If the disease is extensive, especially around the tympanic bulla (middle ear), then the prognosis is guarded.A similar disease seen in young Bullmastiffs is known as calvarial hyperostotic syndrome. It is also similar to human infantile cortical hyperostosis. It is characterized by irregular, progressive bony proliferation and thickening of the cortical bone of the calvaria, which is part of the skull. Asymmetry of the lesions may occur, which makes it different from craniomandibular osteopathy. Symptoms include painful swelling of the skull, fever, and lymph node swelling.

It is a disorder akin to Ehlers–Danlos syndrome now being researched in multiple horse breeds. Originally thought to be a condition of overwork and old age, the disease is now recognized as hereditary and has been seen in horses of all ages, including foals. The latest research has led to the proposed renaming of the disease from DSLD to ESPA because of the systemic and hereditary components now being found.It has been found in many horse breeds, including Arabians, Thoroughbreds, American Quarter Horses, Morgans, Peruvian Pasos, Paso Finos, American Saddlebreds, several breeds of warmblood, Appaloosas, Friesian, Missouri Fox Trotters, Tennessee Walkers, Paints, National Show Horses, and Mustangs, as well as crossbreds and mules.DSLD was once considered a condition of the legs only, as one of the most visible signs is when the fetlocks, particularly on the hind legs, collapse into a \"coon-footed\" position. However, microscopic examination in necropsy has shown DSLD/ESPA horses can be affected not only in the tendons and ligaments of all legs and the patella, but can have affected tissues in the nuchal ligament, eyes, aorta, skin and fascia, lungs and other organs, as well as ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Because of its systemic nature, and because connective tissue is present everywhere in a biological entity, the entire body becomes affected in multiple ways as the disease progresses. Some horses have shown an iron overload in the liver as well.Ongoing research is working on the biochemical aspects of the disease and has found a problem in the transfer growth factor and decorin. It is strongly believed to be passed genetically, and those aspects are being studied in the search for a DNA marker. Research is continuing, and much is yet to be learned."

This disease is common in tropical areas and is not usually found in temperate environments. Demodicosis is characterized by the formation of papules and nodules over the cattle's skin. These lesions most commonly occur on the neck, shoulders, and armpit of cattle; however, sometimes they also appear on the udder. This condition is often found in cattle with increased stress from pregnancy or lactation. Natural and acquired immunity can cause a decrease in the number of mites infesting a cow as well as decreasing the severity of a cow's symptoms.Demodicosis occurs when female mites lay eggs in hair follicles. Each follicle may contain hundreds or thousands of mites, which leads to the formation of skin papules and nodules. These papules and nodules, or bumps beneath the skin, can be felt even before they can be seen. Typically, the papules and nodules last for a month and then are replaced with new ones. They typically are found in the greatest numbers during spring and summer months. Their size can range from as small as a pinhead to as large as a chicken egg. The larger ones are formed when the cysts grow in size, forming granulomatous nodules, characterized by the blocking of the opening of the follicle by mites, keratin, and other remnants. These large cysts can burst, which causes open wounds to form. The thick pus-like substance that comes out of these sores contains Demodex bovis, which can be spread to other animals. Another way mites can be spread is when female mites leave the follicle they are in and go lay eggs in a new follicle. This form of transfer can spread the condition to different follicles on an already infected cow as well as to other cows and animals through copulation or other physical contact. For instance, mites may be transmitted to calves within a few days of nursing, when the shoulders and hips of calves contact the infected mother.The burst nodules and papules can damage the cattle's skin, which results in economic losses due to problems with leather production."

def: "Dermoid sinus is a genetic, autosomal skin condition in dogs. It is also known as pilonidal sinus. However, unlike pilonidal sinus in humans, the dermoid sinus in dogs is a neural tube defect. Dermoid sinus is sometimes also confused with dermoid cyst (a teratoma).A dermoid sinus is rare in dogs and cats. It can appear as single or multiple lumps on the dorsal midline. The sinus is caused in the embryonic stage of development. In normal development, the neural tube from which the spine develops separates from the skin. In the case of a dermoid sinus, this separation has not fully taken place. The result is that in some cases, the dermoid sinus remains connected to the animal's spinal cord; in other cases, the sinus terminates in a \"blind sac\" that is less dangerous to remove. Histologically, the dermoid sinus contains hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and sweat glands. If the sinus becomes infected, it can result in meningitis and myelitis, symptoms of which are spinal pain, rigidity, and fever. In serious cases, the condition can be life threatening. The dermoid sinus gene is believed by some to be recessive, meaning that the animal must receive one defective gene from each parent in order to develop the condition. Where one parent carries the gene and the other does not, the offspring remain carriers and can continue to pass the defective gene on to their offspring in turn. Others believe that the dermoid sinus condition is more appropriately characterized as polygenic, involving multiple genes. In any case, because of the genetic nature of this potentially dangerous condition, most breeders and veterinarians advise against breeding animals that have a dermoid sinus, or have a parent that is known to carry the gene.It has been shown that the problem can be reduced with the use of folic acid in the bitch by administration a week before mating and continuing through the first trimester of pregnancy. It is not a harmful product and is readily available at a minimal cost from the local pharmacist. Surgery is also a popular remedy, with veterinary surgeons removing abnormal tissue and closing any connections to the spine, although in some cases, regrowth of the sinus occurs. A variety of tests, such as a myelogram or a fistulogram may be undertaken to determine how deep the sinus goes. Other, more basic tests, such as a complete blood count, biochemical profile, and urinalysis can be performed to determine if infection or other problems exist. Computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging may be undertaken to determine if neurological signs exist as a result of the sinus.Breeds known to be affected include Rhodesian Ridgeback and Thai Ridgeback, in which it is hereditary, Kerry Blue Terriers, Shih Tzus and Boxers."

In the subsequent decade the disease ravaged Tasmania's wild devils, with estimates of decline ranging from 20% to as much as a 50% of the devil population, across over 65% of the state. Affected high-density populations suffer up to 100% mortality in 12–18 months. The disease has mainly been concentrated in Tasmania's eastern half. Visible signs of DFTD begin with lesions and lumps around the mouth. These develop into cancerous tumours that may spread from the face to the entire body. Once lesions first appear devils usually die within six months owing to organ failure, secondary infection, or metabolic starvation. The tumours interfere with feeding, and the affected animal may starve to death. Devil Facial Tumor Disease affects males and females equally. At present the population has dwindled by 70% since 1996. Numbers as of 2010, 80% of population is infected. The most plausible route of transmission is through biting, particularly, when canine teeth come into direct contact with the diseased cells. Other modes of transmission include, but are not limited to, the ingesting of an infected carcass or the sharing of food, both of which involve an allogeneic transfer of cells between unrelated individuals.Six females have been found with a partial immunity. Breeding in captivity has begun in an attempt to save the population." [Wikipedia:Devil_facial_tumour_disease]

def: "Diabetes mellitus is a disease in which the beta cells of the endocrine pancreas either stop producing insulin or can no longer produce it in enough quantity for the body's needs. The condition is commonly divided into two types, depending on the origin of the condition: Type 1 diabetes, sometimes called \"juvenile diabetes\", is caused by destruction of the beta cells of the pancreas. The condition is also referred to as insulin-dependent diabetes, meaning exogenous insulin injections must replace the insulin the pancreas is no longer capable of producing for the body's needs. Dogs have insulin-dependent, or Type 1, diabetes; research finds no Type 2 diabetes in dogs. Because of this, there is no possibility the permanently damaged pancreatic beta cells could re-activate to engender a remission as may be possible with some feline diabetes cases, where the primary type of diabetes is Type 2. There is another less common form of diabetes, diabetes insipidus, which is a condition of insufficient antidiuretic hormone or resistance to it.This most common form of diabetes strikes 1 in 500 dogs. The condition is treatable and need not shorten the animal's life span or interfere with quality of life. If left untreated, the condition can lead to cataracts, increasing weakness in the legs (neuropathy), malnutrition, ketoacidosis, dehydration, and death. Diabetes mainly affects middle-age and older dogs, but there are juvenile cases. The typical canine diabetes patient is middle-age, female, and overweight at diagnosis.The number of dogs diagnosed with diabetes mellitus has increased three-fold in thirty years. In survival rates from almost the same time, only 50% survived the first 60 days after diagnosis and went on to be successfully treated at home.

namespace: dbpedia
def: "This article is about diseases and parasites in salmon, trout and other salmon-like fishes of the Salmonidae family.According to Canadian biologist Dorothy Kieser, the myxozoan parasite Henneguya salminicola is commonly found in the flesh of salmonids. It has been recorded in the field samples of salmon returning to the Queen Charlotte Islands. The fish responds by walling off the parasitic infection into a number of cysts that contain milky fluid. This fluid is an accumulation of a large number of parasites.Henneguya and other parasites in the myxosporean group have a complex life cycle, where the salmon is one of two hosts. The fish releases the spores after spawning. In the Henneguya case, the spores enter a second host, most likely an invertebrate, in the spawning stream. When juvenile salmon migrate to the Pacific Ocean, the second host releases a stage infective to salmon. The parasite is then carried in the salmon until the next spawning cycle. The myxosporean parasite that causes whirling disease in trout, has a similar life cycle. However, as opposed to whirling disease, the Henneguya infestation does not appear to cause significant incapacitation of the host salmon — even heavily infected fish tend to return to spawn successfully.According to Dr. Kieser, a lot of work on Henneguya salminicola was done by scientists at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo in the mid-1980s, in particular, an overview report which states that \"the fish that have the longest fresh water residence time as juveniles have the most noticeable infections. Hence in order of prevalence coho are most infected followed by sockeye, chinook, chum and pink.\" As well, the report says that, at the time the studies were conducted, stocks from the middle and upper reaches of large river systems in British Columbia such as Fraser, Skeena, Nass and from mainland coastal streams in the southern half of B.C. \"are more likely to have a low prevalence of infection.\" The report also states \"It should be stressed that Henneguya, economically deleterious though it is, is harmless from the view of public health. It is strictly a fish parasite that cannot live in or affect warm blooded animals, including man\".According to Klaus Schallie, Molluscan Shellfish Program Specialist with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, \"Henneguya salminicola is found in southern B.C. also and in all species of salmon. I have previously examined smoked chum salmon sides that were riddled with cysts and some sockeye runs in Barkley Sound (southern B.C., west coast of Vancouver Island) are noted for their high incidence of infestation.\"Sea lice, particularly Lepeophtheirus salmonis and various Caligus species, including C. clemensi and C. rogercresseyi, can cause deadly infestations of both farm-grown and wild salmon. Sea lice are ectoparasites which feed on mucus, blood, and skin, and migrate and latch onto the skin of wild salmon during free-swimming, planktonic nauplii and copepodid larval stages, which can persist for several days. Large numbers of highly populated, open-net salmon farms can create exceptionally large concentrations of sea lice; when exposed in river estuaries containing large numbers of open-net farms, many young wild salmon are infected, and do not survive as a result. Adult salmon may survive otherwise critical numbers of sea lice, but small, thin-skinned juvenile salmon migrating to sea are highly vulnerable. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the louse-induced mortality of pink salmon in some regions is commonly over 80%." [Wikipedia:Diseases_and_parasites_in_salmon]

def: "Echinococcosis, also called hydatid disease, hydatidosis, or echinococcal disease, is a parasitic disease of tapeworms of the Echinococcus type. People get two main types of disease, cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis. There are two less common forms polycystic echinococcosis and unicystic echinococcosis. The disease often starts without symptoms and this may last for a year. The symptoms and signs that occur depend on the cysts location and size. Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs or brain. When the liver is affected the person may have abdominal pain, weight loss, and turn yellow. Lung disease may cause pain in the chest, shortness of breath and a cough.The disease is spread when food or water that contains the eggs of the parasite is eaten or by close contact with an infected animal. The eggs are released in the stool of meat eating animals that are infected by the parasite. Commonly infected animals include: dogs, foxes and wolves. For these animals to become infected they must eat the organs of an animal that contains the cysts such as sheep or rodents. The type of disease which occurs in people depends on the type of Echinococcus causing the infection. Diagnosis is usually by ultrasound though computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. Blood tests looking for antibodies against the parasite may be helpful as may biopsy.Prevention of cystic disease is by treating dogs that may carry the disease and vaccination of sheep. Treatment is often difficult. The cystic disease may be drained through the skin followed by medication. Sometimes this type of disease is just watched. The alveolar type often needs surgery followed by medications. The medication used is albendazole which may be needed for years. The alveolar disease may result in death.The disease occurs in most areas of the world and currently affects about one million people. In some areas of South America, Africa, and Asia up to 10% of the certain populations are affected. As of 2010 it caused about 1200 deaths down from 2000 in 1990. The economic cost of the disease is estimated to be around 3 billion USD a year. It can affect other animals such as pigs, cows and horses." [Wikipedia:Echinococcosis]

def: "Echinococcus granulosus, also called the Hydatid worm or Hyper Tape-worm or Dog Tapeworm, is a cyclophyllid cestode that parasitizes the small intestine of canids as an adult, but which has important intermediate hosts such as livestock and humans, where it causes cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease. The adult tapeworm ranges in length from 2 mm to 7 mm and has three proglottids (\"segments\") when intact — an immature proglottid, mature proglottid and a gravid proglottid. Like all cyclophyllideans, E. granulosus has four suckers on its scolex (\"head\"), and E. granulosus also has a rostellum with hooks. Several strains of E. granulosus have been identified, and all but two are noted to be infective in humans (Eckert & Deplazes 2004).The lifecycle of E. granulosus involves dogs and wild carnivores as a definitive host for the adult tapeworm (Moro & Shantz 2008). Definitive hosts are where parasites reach maturity and reproduce. Wild or domesticated ungulates, such as sheep, serve as an intermediate host (Moro & Shantz 2008). Transitions between life stages occur in intermediate hosts. The larval stage results in the formation of echinococcal cysts in intermediate hosts (Moro & Shantz 2008). Echinococcal cysts are slow growing (Moro & Shantz 2008), but can cause clinical symptoms in humans and be life-threatening (McManus et al. 2003). Cysts may not initially cause symptoms, in some cases for many years (Moro & Shantz 2008). Symptoms developed depend on location of the cyst, but most occur in the liver, lungs, or both (McManus et al. 2003). E. granulosus was first document in Alaska but is distributed world-wide. It is especially prevalent in parts of Eurasia, north and east Africa, Australia, and South America (McManus et al. 2003). Communities that practice sheep farming experience the highest risk to humans (McManus et al. 2003), but wild animals can also serve as an avenue for transmission. For example, dingoes serve as a definitive host before larvae infect sheep in the mainland of Australia (McManus et al. 2003). Sled dogs may expose moose or reindeer to E. granulosus in parts of North America and Eurasia (McManus et al. 2003)." [Wikipedia:Echinococcus_granulosus]

The disease is spread by bont ticks, which are members of the genus Amblyomma. Affected mammals include cattle, sheep, goats, antelope, and buffalo, but the disease has the biggest economic impact on cattle production in affected areas. The disease’s name is derived from the fact that fluid can collect around the heart or in the lungs of infected animals.The disease is common in subsaharan Africa and some of the West Indian islands. It was first identified in sheep in South Africa in the 1830s, and had reached the Caribbean by 1980. The ticks which carry the disease occur in Africa and the Caribbean, and feed on a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. In the Caribbean, at least, the Cattle Egret has been implicated in the spread of heartwater since it colonized the islands in the 1950s.

def: "This article pertains to elbow dysplasia in the dog.Elbow dysplasia is a condition involving multiple developmental abnormalities of the elbow-joint in the dog, specifically the growth of cartilage or the structures surrounding it. These abnormalities, known as 'primary lesions', give rise to osteoarthritic processes. Elbow dysplasia is a common condition of certain breeds of dogs.Most primary lesions are related to osteochondrosis, which is a disease of the joint cartilage and specifically Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD), the separation of a flap of cartilage on the joint surface. Other common causes of elbow dysplasia included ununited anconeal process (UAP) and fragmented or ununited medial coronoid process (FCP or FMCP).Osteochondritis dissecans is difficult to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an unusual gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia. The problem develops in puppyhood although often subclinically, and there may be pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame, before then non-surgical control is usually used.[citation needed]" [Wikipedia:Elbow_dysplasia]

In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.The first case of a fatal form of the disease was documented in 1995, though tissue samples from as early as the 1980s have since tested positive for the virus, and localized skin lesions in wild African elephants were recorded in the 1970s. Since 1995, there have been over fifty documented disease cases in North America and Europe, of which only nine have been successfully cured. Those affected are mostly young animals born in captivity, though a small number of older wild-born adults held in zoos have died, and a number of cases caused by the same pathogenic type of EEHV have recently been identified in both orphan and wild calves in Asian elephant populations."

It is an infectious, and sometimes fatal, virus that is characterized by extensive hemorrhages, and is found throughout the United States. It is important for deer hunters, farmers, farm property owners, and livestock owners to have knowledge about EHD because of the seriousness of this disease, its ability to cause large scale outbreaks in wild ruminants, and its ability to affect livestock and the production industry (EHD in White-tailed Deer: Michigan Wildlife Disease Manual). Epizootic hemorrhagic disease has been found in some domestic ruminants and many species of deer including white-tailed deer, mule deer, and pronghorn antelope (CFSPH 2006). Seropositive black-tailed deer, fallow deer, red deer, wapiti, and roe deer have also been found, which essentially means that they were exposed to the disease at some time in the past, but may not be involved in transmission. Outbreaks of EHD have been reported in cattle although it is rare for them to develop disease or die. Sheep may develop clinical signs; however, this is also rare (Howarth et al. 2001).Epizootic hemorrhagic disease is often called bluetongue; however, this is incorrect. Bluetongue virus is closely related to EHD, and has similar clinical signs, but it is a different disease. Bluetongue is a serious disease in cattle, as well as other ruminants, and can have a significant effect on international trade. Testing at animal health laboratories is necessary to distinguish between the viruses that cause bluetongue and EHD." [Wikipedia:Epizootic_Hemorrhagic_Disease]

Initial spread of EHV-1 by a newly introduced horse through direct and indirect contact can lead to abortion and perinatal infection in up to 70 percent of a previously unexposed herd. Abortion usually occurs in the last four months of gestation, two to four weeks after infection of the mare. Perinatal (around the time of birth) infection can lead to pneumonia and death. Encephalitis can occur in affected animals, leading to ataxia, paralysis, and death. There is a vaccine available (ATCvet code QI05AA11), however its efficacy is questionable.The virus cross-reacts with Equine herpesvirus 4 in many serological laboratory tests. Commercial diagnostic tests are available to distinguish the two viruses using monoclontal antibody based reagents. The virus is easily isolated in cell culture and can be readily detected during acute infection using molecular diagnostic methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Recent molecular epidemiology studies have identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) which varies between EHV-1 field isolates and shows a highly statistically significant correlation with paralytic compared with non-paralytic disease outbreaks. The SNP corresponds to a single amino acid change in the DNA polymerase enzyme, which is an essential enzyme for replication of viral DNA. This is a significant finding, suggesting that a point mutation in a single virus gene has a major impact upon likely disease severity during an outbreak.In 2006, an outbreak of EHV-1 among stables in Florida resulted in the institution of various quarantine measures. The outbreak was determined to have originated with several horses imported from Europe via New York, and then shipped to Florida." [Wikipedia:Equine_herpesvirus_1]

Signs of the disease include pustules and ulcerations of the vagina, penis, prepuce, and perineum. Lesions may also be seen on the lips and teats. Usually the only symptom seen is a decreased libido in stallions. The lesions heal within two weeks. As with other herpes viruses, the virus remains latent in the host for life. Carrier animals can sometimes be identified by spots of pigment loss on black skin in the genital region.EHV-3 is best prevented by taking note of present clinical signs and keeping infected horses isolated and breeding stock from sexual contact with other horses. Antibiotic ointments should be used on the lesions to prevent secondary bacterial infections and hasten the healing process. It is also important to use disposable gloves and instruments in veterinary exams as the virus can be spread by using contaminated equipment." [Wikipedia:Equine_herpesvirus_3]

Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination. The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria.E. coli and other facultative anaerobes constitute about 0.1% of gut flora, and fecal–oral transmission is the major route through which pathogenic strains of the bacterium cause disease. Cells are able to survive outside the body for a limited amount of time, which makes them ideal indicator organisms to test environmental samples for fecal contamination. There is, however, a growing body of research that has examined environmentally persistent E. coli which can survive for extended periods outside of the host.The bacterium can be grown easily and inexpensively in a laboratory setting, and has been intensively investigated for over 60 years. E. coli is the most widely studied prokaryotic model organism, and an important species in the fields of biotechnology and microbiology, where it has served as the host organism for the majority of work with recombinant DNA.

In the case of Graves' disease, the displacement of the eye is due to abnormal connective tissue deposition in the orbit and extraocular muscles which can be visualized by CT or MRI.If left untreated, exophthalmos can cause the eyelids to fail to close during sleep leading to corneal dryness and damage. Another possible complication would be a form of redness or irritation called \"Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis\", where the area above the cornea becomes inflamed as a result of increased friction when blinking.

It is a common result of head trauma and pressure exerted on the front of the neck too hard in dogs. Most commonly it occurs in brachycephalic (short nosed) breeds. In cats, eye proptosis is uncommon and is often accompanied by facial fractures.About 40 percent of proptosed eyes retain vision after being replaced in the orbit, but in cats very few retain vision. Replacement of the eye requires general anesthesia. The eyelids are pulled outward, and the eye is gently pushed back into place. The eyelids are sewn together in a procedure known as tarsorrhaphy for about five days to keep the eye in place. Replaced eyes have a higher rate keratoconjunctivitis sicca and keratitis and often require lifelong treatment. If there is severe damage, the eye is removed in a relatively simple surgery known as enucleation of the eye.The prognosis for a replaced eye is determined by the extent of damage to the cornea and sclera, the presence or absence of a pupillary light reflex, and the presence of ruptured rectus muscles. The rectus muscles normally help hold the eye in place and direct eye movement. Rupture of more than two rectus muscles usually requires that the eye be removed, because there is usually also significant blood vessel and nerve damage. Compared to brachycephalic breeds, dochilocephalic (long nosed) breeds usually have more trauma to the eye and its surrounding structures, so there is a worse prognosis." [Wikipedia:Eye_proptosis]

The fungus requires warm humid weather with night time temperatures of over 13°C (55°F) for several days, and litter at the bottom of the sward.Pithomyces chartarum occurs worldwide but is a problem predominantly where farm animals are intensively grazed, especially in New Zealand.The spores of the fungus release the mycotoxin Sporidesmin in the gastrointestinal tract, causing a blockage in the bile ducts that leads to injury of the liver. Bile, chlorophyll and other waste products consequently build up in the bloodstream causing photo sensitivity of the skin especially that exposed to direct sunlight. This in turn causes severe skin irritation that the animal attempts to relieve by rubbing its head against available objects, resulting in peeling of the skin.The large family of fungi that produce mycotoxins, of which sporidesmin is one, live mainly on ryegrasses and can cause significant problems in grazing animals. Sporidesmin can lower an animals immunity and affect total production in farm animals, and, when taken in larger quantities, can result in death.The clinical symptoms of FE are distressing: restlessness, frequent urination, shaking, persistent rubbing of the head against objects (e.g. fences, trees etc.), drooping and reddened ears, swollen eyes, and avoidance of sunlight by seeking shade. Exposed areas of skin develop weeping dermatitis and scabs that can become infected and attractive to blow-fly causing myiasis." [Wikipedia:Facial_eczema]

Experts do not agree on the specifics of genetic changes that produce the FIPV. The mutated virus has the ability to invade and grow in certain white blood cells, namely macrophages. The immune system's response causes an intense inflammatory reaction in the containing tissues. This disease is generally fatal. However, its incidence rate is roughly 1 in 5000 for households with one or two cats. A nasally administered vaccine for FIP is available, but controversial and isn't proven to be highly effective. An experimental polyprenyl immunostimulant is being manufactured by Sass and Sass and tested by Dr. Al Legendre. In one case study, a female cat diagnosed with dry FIP has survived 26 months from the date of definitive diagnosis.[citation needed]" [Wikipedia:Feline_infectious_peritonitis]

FLUTD is a common disease in adult cats, affecting from 0.5% to 1% of the population. FLUTD affects cats of both sexes, but tends to be more dangerous in males because they are more susceptible to blockages due to their longer, narrower urethrae. Urinary tract disorders have a high rate of recurrence, and some cats seem to be more susceptible to urinary problems than others.The older term, Feline urologic syndrome (FUS) was renamed to discourage the perception that the clinical signs seen represent one disease with one cause."

These are divided into three groups according to the niche within the body they occupy: Lymphatic filariasis is caused by the worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. These worms occupy the lymphatic system, including the lymph nodes; in chronic cases, these worms lead to the disease elephantiasis.Subcutaneous filariasis is caused by Loa loa (the eye worm), Mansonella streptocerca, and Onchocerca volvulus. These worms occupy the subcutaneous layer of the skin, in the fat layer. L. loa causes Loa loa filariasis, while O. volvulus causes river blindness.Serous cavity filariasis is caused by the worms Mansonella perstans and Mansonella ozzardi, which occupy the serous cavity of the abdomen.The adult worms, which usually stay in one tissue, release early larval forms known as microfilariae into the host's bloodstream. These circulating microfilariae can be taken up with a blood meal by the arthropod vector; in the vector, they develop into infective larvae that can be transmitted to a new host.Individuals infected by filarial worms may be described as either \"microfilaraemic\" or \"amicrofilaraemic\", depending on whether or not microfilariae can be found in their peripheral blood. Filariasis is diagnosed in microfilaraemic cases primarily through direct observation of microfilariae in the peripheral blood. Occult filariasis is diagnosed in amicrofilaraemic cases based on clinical observations and, in some cases, by finding a circulating antigen in the blood." [Wikipedia:Filariasis]

Sometimes, both types of infection are seen together. Infection is commonly brought on by bad water conditions, injury, poor diet, or as a secondary infection in a fish which is already stressed by other disease. Fin rot starts at the edge of the fins, and destroys more and more tissue until it reaches the fin base. If it does reach the fin base, the fish will never be able to regenerate the lost tissue. At this point, the disease may attack the fish's body directly. Fin rot is common in bettas due to poor water conditions in pet stores." [Wikipedia:Fin_rot]

This either alone or in combination with bacterial infection destroys the gut tissue. Bacterial pathogens contributing to infectious flaccherie are Serratia marcescens, and species of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus in the form known as thatte roga.Louis Pasteur, who began his studies on silkworms diseases in 1865, was the first one able to recognize that mortality due to viral flacherie was caused by infection.

name: flat-chested kitten syndrome
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Flat-chested kitten syndrome (FCKS), is a disorder in cats, wherein kittens develop a compression of the thorax (chest/ribcage) caused by lung collapse. In mild cases, the underside of the chest becomes flattened (hence the name of the condition); in extreme cases the entire thorax is flattened, looking as if the kitten has been stepped on. The kitten will appear to go from normal to flat in the space of about 2-3 hours, and will usually then stabilise.FCKS is most frequently caused by collapsed lungs (and not as formerly believed, by a muscle spasm in the intercostal muscles). There are numerous causes for lung collapse, and therefore numerous causes for FCKS. One possible cause for flat chestedness that develops soon after birth is atelectasis.Causes of atelectasis include insufficient attempts at respiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, or absence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveoli that coats the lungs and prevents the surfaces from sticking together). Lack of surfactant reduces the surface area available for effective gas exchange causing lung collapse if severe. There can be many reasons for atelectasis in kittens, but probably the commonest cause is prematurity. Newborn atelectasis would not be unusual in a very large litter of kittens (such as 10), where the size of the litter may lead all the kittens to be small and mildly underdeveloped.Unlike human babies, kittens are born very immature: blind, deaf, the intestinal tract not fully developed etc., so even slight prematurity may tip them over the edge from being viable to non viable. Many FCKS kittens may have fallen just the wrong side of this boundary in their development at the time of birth. Further, if a kitten does not scream or open its lungs well enough at birth, even if it is fully mature and has sufficient surfactant, it may end up with atelectasis. Patches of atelectasis in the lungs mean that part of a lung is not operating properly. If the kitten goes to sleep and its respiratory rate drops, the patches of atelectasis can slowly expand until large areas of the lung collapse and cannot be reinflated. Good advice to any breeder therefore would be to ensure that kittens cry loudly when they are born, to make sure that the airways are clear, but also that the lungs expand as fully as possible. (This was the reason newborn babies were always held upside down immediately after birth (so that any residual fluid drains downwards) and smacked to make them cry strongly.)Some kittens suffer from congenital 'secondary' atelectasis, which presents shortly after birth. There have been no reports of kittens born flat (primary atelectasis). Hyaline membrane disease is a type of respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn in which there is formation of a hyaline-like membrane lining the terminal respiratory passages, and this may also be a (rarer) cause of FCKS. Pressure from outside the lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well as obstruction of lung air passages by mucus resulting from various infections and lung diseases – which may explain the development of FCKS in older kittens (e.g. 10 days old) who are not strong enough to breathe through even a light mucus, or who may have inhaled milk during suckling.Tumors and inhaled objects (possible if bedding contains loose fluff) can also cause obstruction or irritation of the airway, leading to lung collapse and secondary atelectasis. In an older cat the intercostal muscles are so well developed, and the ribs rigid enough that the ribcage will not flatten if the lung collapses: in kittens the bones are much more flexible, and the tendons and muscles more flaccid, allowing movement of the thorax into abnormal positions.Other causes of lung collapse can include diaphragmatic hernia, or diaphragmatic spasm (breeders report the position of the gut and thorax as appearing to be like a 'stalled hiccup'). Diaphragmatic spasm is easily checked by pinching the phrenic nerve in the neck between the fingertips. Kittens with this type of FCKS will improve almost immediately, but may require repeated pinching to prevent the spasm from recurring." [Wikipedia:Flat-chested_kitten_syndrome]

The virus causes a high fever for two or three days, followed by blisters inside the mouth and on the feet that may rupture and cause lameness.Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has severe implications for animal farming, since it is highly infectious and can be spread by infected animals through aerosols, through contact with contaminated farming equipment, vehicles, clothing, or feed, and by domestic and wild predators. Its containment demands considerable efforts in vaccination, strict monitoring, trade restrictions, and quarantines, and occasionally the killing of animals.Susceptible animals include cattle, water buffalo, sheep, goats, pigs, antelope, deer, and bison. It has also been known to infect hedgehogs and elephants; llamas, and alpacas may develop mild symptoms, but are resistant to the disease and do not pass it on to others of the same species. In laboratory experiments, mice, rats, and chickens have been successfully infected by artificial means, but they are not believed to contract the disease under natural conditions. Humans are very rarely infected.The virus responsible for the disease is a picornavirus, the prototypic member of the genus Aphthovirus. Infection occurs when the virus particle is taken into a cell of the host. The cell is then forced to manufacture thousands of copies of the virus, and eventually bursts, releasing the new particles in the blood. The virus is genetically highly variable, which limits the effectiveness of vaccination." [Wikipedia:Foot-and-mouth_disease]

namespace: dbpedia
def: "Foot rot, or infectious pododermatitis, is a hoof infection commonly found in sheep, goats, and cattle. As the name suggests, it rots away the foot of the animal, more specifically the area between the two toes of the affected animal. It is extremely painful and contagious. It can be treated with a series of medications, but if not treated, the whole herd can become infected. The cause of the infection in cattle are two species of anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that can grow without oxygen), Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. Both bacteria are common to the environment in which cattle live, and Fusobacterium is present in the rumen and fecal matter of the cattle. In sheep, the Fusobacterium necrophorum first invades the interdigital skin following damage to the skin, and causes interdigital lesions and slight inflammation. The second stage of the disease is marked by the invasion of the foot by the foot rot bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus, a Gram-negative anaerobe. Usually, there is an injury to the skin between the hooves that allows the bacteria to infect the animal. Another cause of foot rot may be high temperatures or humidity, causing the skin between the hooves to crack and let the bacteria infect the foot. This is one of the reasons foot rot is such a major problem in the summer. Foot rot is easily identifiable by its appearance and foul odor. Treatment is usually with an antibiotic medication, and preventing injury to the feet is the best way to prevent foot rot.The disease is different in cattle and sheep and cross-infection is not thought to occur."

Besides chickens, the disease also concerns turkeys, ducks, geese, raptors, and canaries. Turkeys are particularly sensitive, with mortality ranging to 65%. The recognition of this pathological condition is of ever increasing importance for differential diagnosis with avian influenza." [Wikipedia:Fowl_cholera]

There are two forms of the disease. The first is spread by biting insects (especially mosquitoes) and wound contamination and causes lesions on the comb, wattles, and beak. Birds affected by this form usually recover within a few weeks. The second form is spread by inhalation of the virus and causes a diphtheritic membrane to form in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and sometimes the trachea. The prognosis for this form is poor."

It can be contracted by other animals such as dogs, cats and goats. It is caused by infection with the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, usually by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Signs of glanders include the formation of nodular lesions in the lungs and ulceration of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract. The acute form results in coughing, fever and the release of an infectious nasal discharge, followed by septicaemia and death within days. In the chronic form, nasal and subcutaneous nodules develop, eventually ulcerating. Death can occur within months, while survivors act as carriers.Glanders is endemic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Central and South America. It has been eradicated from North America, Australia and most of Europe through surveillance and destruction of affected animals, and import restrictions.Burkholderia mallei is able to infect humans and is therefore classed as a zoonotic agent. Transmission occurs by direct contact with infected animals and entry is through skin abrasions, nasal and oral mucosal surfaces, or by inhalation.The mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for glanders. Mallein (ATCvet code: QI05AR01), a protein fraction of the glanders organism (Burkholderia mallei), is injected intradermo-palpebrally or given by eye-drop. In infected animals, the eyelid swells markedly in 1 or 2 days.Glanders has not been reported in the United States since 1945. It is a notifiable disease in the UK, although it has not been reported in this country since 1928." [Wikipedia:Glanders]

The lesions of GME exist mainly in the white matter of the cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The cause is only known to be noninfectious and is considered at this time to be idiopathic. Because lesions resemble those seen in allergic meningoencephalitis, GME is thought to have an immune-mediated cause, but it is also thought that the disease may be based on an abnormal response to an infectious agent. One study searched for viral DNA from canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus, and canine parvovirus in brain tissue from dogs with GME, necrotizing meningoencephalitis, and necrotizing leukoencephalitis (see below for the latter two conditions), but failed to find any."

After hatching from their eggs, H. contortus larvae molt several times, resulting in an L3 form that is infectious for the animals. They can take up these larvae when eating grass leaves. The L4 larvae, formed after another molt, suck blood in the abomasum of the animal, potentially giving rise to anaemia and oedema, which eventually can lead to death.The infection, called haemonchosis, causes large economic losses for farmers around the world, especially for those living in the warmer climates. Antihelminthics are used to combat these, and other, worm infections for a long time, but resistance of the parasites against these chemicals is growing." [Wikipedia:Haemonchus_contortus]

Two other genera – Halteridium and Simondia – are now considered to be synonyms of Haemoproteus.The protozoa are intracellular parasites that infect the erythrocytes. They are transmitted by blood sucking insects including mosquitoes, biting midges (Culicoides), louse flies (Hippoboscidae) and tabanid flies (Tabanidae). Infection with this genus is sometimes known as pseudomalaria because of the parasites' similarities with Plasmodium species.Within the genus there are at least 173 species, 5 varieties and 1 subspecies. Of these over 140 occur in birds, 16 in reptiles and 3 in amphibia: 14 orders and 50 families of birds are represented. These include gamebirds (Galliformes), waterfowl (Anseriformes), raptors (Accipitriformes, Falconiformes, Strigiformes), pigeons and doves (Columbiformes), and perching birds or songbirds (Passeriformes)."

Hairballs are sometimes mistaken for other conditions of the stomach such as lymphosarcoma, tuberculosis, and tumour of the spleen. Cats are especially prone to hairball formation since they groom themselves by licking their fur, and thereby ingest it. Rabbits are also prone to hairballs because they groom themselves in the same fashion as cats, but hairballs are especially dangerous for rabbits because they cannot regurgitate them. Because the digestive system of a rabbit is very fragile, rabbit hairballs must be treated immediately or they may cause the animal to stop feeding and ultimately die due to dehydration. Cattle are also known to accumulate hairballs, but as they do not vomit, these are found usually after death and can be quite large." [Wikipedia:Hairball]

The chordae tendinae can be fused or thickened. The papillary muscles can be enlarged or atrophied. The cause is unknown, but genetics play a large role. Dogs and cats with tricuspid valve dysplasia often also have an open foramen ovale, an atrial septal defect, or inflammation of the right atrial epicardium. In dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia can be similar to Ebstein's anomaly in humans.Mitral valve stenosis is one of the most common congenital heart defects in cats. In dogs, it is most commonly found in Great Danes, German Shepherd Dogs, Bull Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Newfoundlands, and Mastiffs. Tricuspid valve dysplasia is most common in the Old English Sheepdog, German Shepherd Dog, Weimaraner, Labrador Retriever, Great Pyrenees, and sometimes the Papillon.[citation needed] It is inherited in the Labrador Retriever.The disease and symptoms are similar to progression of acquired valve disease in older dogs. Valve leakage leads to heart enlargement, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Heart valve dysplasia can be tolerated for years or progress to heart failure in the first year of life.

Most affected individuals receive an injury they cannot heal, and are euthanized. Managed breeding strategy is currently the only option for reducing the incidence of the disease. The disease is found primarily in the American Quarter Horse, specifically in cutting horse lines. Affected horses have been found to trace to the stallion Poco Bueno, or possibly, farther back to one of his ancestors. Researchers have now named four deceased Quarter Horse stallions that were carriers and produced at least one affacted HERDA foal; they are Dry Doc, Doc O'Lena, Great Pine, and Zippo Pine Bar. These stallions all trace to Poco Bueno through his son and daughter Poco Pine and Poco Lena. Other breeds affected are the American Paint Horse (APHA), and the Appaloosa (ApHC) and any other breed registry that allows outcrossing to AQHA horses.HERDA is characterized by abnormal skin along the back that tears or rips easily and heals into disfiguring scars. The skin is loose, and hyper-elastic in affected horses. Symptoms typically don’t appear until the horse is subjected to pressure or injury on their back, neck or hips, usually around two years of age. However foals can show signs when injured, while other horses mature and only show signs in the joints. The expression of HERDA is variable, and the phenotypic range of expression is still being determined.After being tested, the results either show \"normal\", \"carrier\" or \"affected\" and can be determined by DNA testing of either a blood or hair sample.N/N - Normal: does not have the HERDA geneN/HRD- Carrier: carries one copy of the geneHRD/HRD- Affected: has two copies of the geneThe expected lifespan of an affected horse is 2–4 years. There is currently no cure for this disease. To prevent it from occurring, the only solution is not to breed horses who both carry the HERDA allele."

def: "The Highlands J (HJ) virus is a zoonotic alphavirus native to North and South America. It maintains a natural reservoir in the songbird population of freshwater swamps (generally scrub jays and blue jays) and is transmitted by the bite of the female Culiseta melanura mosquito. Though nearly identical in structure and natural cycle to the Eastern equine encephalitis virus, it is considerably less virulent than its cousin, causing relatively mild symptoms in its primary avian reservoir and only nominally capable of transmission to mammals. A 1995 study conducted in Florida swampland found that 15% of swamp-dwelling jays tested positive for HJ antibodies, all of which were asymptomatic and in apparent good health. Recorded bird deaths from HJ infection are uncommon but not rare, and include several domestic turkeys at a commercial facility and young broiler chickens in an experimental setting.Transmission to equines or humans via mosquito is also possible, though even more rare. During the 1990-1991 St. Louis encephalitis outbreak in Missouri, 4 patients were found to be comorbidly infected with SLE and HJ, though no harmful effects were attributed to the HJ alone. A limited survey of swamp-dwelling rodents in Florida found one cotton mouse and one cotton rat with antibodies to HJ, both asymptomatic. The sole mammalian fatality attributed to HJ was a Florida horse originally diagnosed with Western equine encephalitis in 1964, which was later redetermined in 1989 to have been caused by HJ.Despite its negligible virulence in humans, it is often tested for in US domestic mosquito control programs as an indicator of fruitful conditions for other mosquito-borne zoonoses to multiply."

Two species of hookworms commonly infect humans, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. A. duodenale predominates in the Middle East, North Africa, India and (formerly) in southern Europe, while N. americanus predominates in the Americas, Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia. Hookworms are thought to infect more than 600 million people worldwide. The A. braziliense and A. tubaeforme species infect cats, while A. caninum infects canines. Uncinaria stenocephala infects both dogs and cats. Ancylostoma caninum has infected humans, with 150 cases reported in Brisbane, Australia from 1988-1992.Hookworms are much smaller than the giant roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), and the complications of tissue migration and mechanical obstruction so frequently observed with roundworm infestation are less frequent in hookworm infestation. The most significant risk of hookworm infection is anemia, secondary to loss of iron (and protein) in the gut. The worms suck blood voraciously and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.Ancylostomiasis, also known by several other names, is the disease caused when A. duodenale hookworms, present in large numbers, produce an iron deficiency anemia by sucking blood from the host's intestinal walls.Hookworm affects about 576 million people globally. It is a leading cause of maternal and child morbidity in the developing countries of the tropics and subtropics. In susceptible children hookworms cause intellectual, cognitive and growth retardation, intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, and low birth weight among newborns born to infected mothers. In developed countries, hookworm infection is rarely fatal, but anemia can be significant in a heavily infected individual." [Wikipedia:Hookworm]

A bacterial infection may develop.As the lesion grows, secondary infection from opportunistic bacteria can occur, causing more discomfort and leading the pet to scratch and chew even more. Other names include wet eczema, moist eczema, summer sores, acute moist alderman, acute moist dermatitis, pyo traumatic dermatitis, or acute pyo traumatic dermatitis. As the nickname \"summer sores\" suggests, hot spots are more common in the summer; however, the ailment can occur at any time of the year.

It is most commonly associated with horses, but occurs in humans, where it may be called Gamstorp episodic adynamy. It is characterized by muscle hyperexcitability or weakness which, exacerbated by potassium or cold, can lead to uncontrolled shaking followed by paralysis. Onset in humans usually occurs in early childhood.The mutation which causes this disorder is dominant on SCN4A with linkage to the sodium channel expressed in muscle. The mutation causes single amino acid changes in parts of the channel which are important for inactivation. In the presence of high potassium levels, including those induced by diet, sodium channels fail to inactivate properly.Equine hyperkalaemic periodic paralysis occurs in 1 in 50 quarter horses and can be traced to a single ancestor, a stallion named Impressive."

Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. The opposite is hypothyroidism ('sluggish thyroid'), which is the reduced production and secretion of T3 and/or T4.Hyperthyroidism is one cause of thyrotoxicosis—the hypermetabolic clinical syndrome which occurs when there are elevated serum levels of T3 and/or T4. Thyrotoxicosis can also occur without hyperthyroidism. Some people develop thyrotoxicosis due to inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis), which can lead to excessive release of thyroid hormone already stored in the gland (without the accelerated hormone production that characterizes hyperthyroidism). Thyrotoxicosis can also occur after ingestion of excessive amounts of exogenous thyroid hormone in the form of thyroid hormone supplements, such as levothyroxine (a phenomenon known as exogenous thyrotoxicosis, alimentary thyrotoxicosis, or occult factitial thyrotoxicosis).Disease management and therapy differ for thyrotoxicosis caused by hyperthyroidism and thyrotoxicosis caused by other conditions.

It is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.The occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a significant cause of sudden unexpected cardiac death in any age group and as a cause of disabling cardiac symptoms. Younger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[citation needed]HCM is frequently asymptomatic until sudden cardiac death, and for this reason some suggest routinely screening certain populations for this disease.A cardiomyopathy is a disease that affects the muscle of the heart. With HCM, the sarcomeres (contractile elements) in the heart increase in size, which results in the thickening of the heart muscle. In addition, the normal alignment of muscle cells is disrupted, a phenomenon known as myocardial disarray. HCM also causes disruptions of the electrical functions of the heart. HCM is most commonly due to a mutation in one of 9 sarcomeric genes that results in a mutated protein in the sarcomere, the primary component of the myocyte (the muscle cell of the heart). These are predominantly single-point missense mutations in the genes for beta-myosin heavy chain (MHC), myosin-binding protein C, cardiac troponinT, or tropomyosin. These mutations cause myofibril and myocyte structural abnormalities and possible deficiencies in force generation.While most literature so far focuses on European, American, and Japanese populations, HCM appears in all racial groups. The prevalence of HCM is about 0.2% to 0.5% of the general population." [Wikipedia:Hypertrophic_cardiomyopathy]

Severe cases will develop bleeding disorders, which can cause hematomas to form in the mouth. Death can occur secondary to this or the liver disease. However, most dogs recover after a brief illness, although chronic corneal edema and kidney lesions may persist.Diagnosis is made by recognizing the combination of symptoms and abnormal blood tests that occur in infectious canine hepatitis. A rising antibody titer to CAV-1 is also seen. The disease can be confused with canine parvovirus because both will cause a low white blood cell count and bloody diarrhea in young, unvaccinated dogs.Treatment is symptomatic. Most dogs recover spontaneously without treatment. Prevention is through vaccination (ATCvet code QI07AA05 and various combination vaccines). Most combination vaccines for dogs contain a modified canine adenovirus type-2. CAV-2 is one of the causes of respiratory infections in dogs, but it is similar enough to CAV-1 that vaccine for one creates immunity for both. CAV-2 vaccine is much less likely to cause side effects than CAV-1 vaccine. One study has shown the vaccine to have a duration of immunity of at least four years.CAV-1 is destroyed in the environment by steam cleaning and quaternary ammonium compounds. Otherwise, the virus can survive in the environment for months in the right conditions. It can also be released in the urine of a recovered dog for up to a year."

def: "Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), is a negative-sense single-stranded, bullet-shaped RNA virus that is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family, and from the genus Novirhabdovirus. It causes the disease known as infectious hematopoietic necrosis in salmonid fish such as trout and salmon. The disease may be referred to by a number of other names such as Chinook salmon disease, Coleman disease, Columbia River sockeye disease, Cultus Lake virus disease, Oregon sockeye disease, Sacramento River Chinook disease and sockeye salmon viral disease. IHNV is commonly found in the Pacific Coast of Canada and the USA, and has also been found in Europe and Japan. The first reported epidemics of IHNV occurred in the United States at the Washington and the Oregon fish hatcheries during the 1950s.IHNV is transmitted following shedding of the virus in the feces, urine, sexual fluids, and external mucus and by direct contact or close contact with surrounding water. The virus gains entry into fish at the base of the fins.The disease is listed as a nonexotic disease of the EU and is therefore watched closely by the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases. To keep track of the distribution of different IHNV genotypes, a database called Fishpathogens.eu has been created to store data on different fish pathogens (including IHNV) and their sequences."

def: "Influenza, commonly known as \"the flu\", is an infectious disease of birds and mammals caused by RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae, the influenza viruses. The most common symptoms are chills, fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache (often severe), coughing, weakness/fatigue and general discomfort. Although it is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses, especially the common cold, influenza is a more severe disease caused by a different type of virus. Influenza may produce nausea and vomiting, particularly in children, but these symptoms are more common in the unrelated gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as \"stomach flu\" or \"24-hour flu\".Typically, influenza is transmitted through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus. Influenza can also be transmitted by direct contact with bird droppings or nasal secretions, or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Airborne aerosols have been thought to cause most infections, although which means of transmission is most important is not absolutely clear. Influenza viruses can be inactivated by sunlight, disinfectants and detergents. As the virus can be inactivated by soap, frequent hand washing reduces the risk of infection. Flu can occasionally lead to pneumonia, either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia, even for persons who are usually very healthy. In particular it is a warning sign if a child (or presumably an adult) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever as this relapse may be bacterial pneumonia. Another warning sign is if the person starts to have trouble breathing.Vaccinations against influenza are usually made available to people in developed countries. Farmed poultry is often vaccinated to avoid decimation of the flocks. The most common human vaccine is the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) that contains purified and inactivated antigens from three viral strains. Typically, this vaccine includes material from two influenza A virus subtypes and one influenza B virus strain. The TIV carries no risk of transmitting the disease. A vaccine formulated for one year may be ineffective in the following year, since the influenza virus evolves rapidly, and new strains quickly replace the older ones. Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir among others have been used to treat influenza. Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks. No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.Influenza spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics, resulting in about three to five million yearly cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 yearly deaths, rising to millions in some pandemic years. In the 20th century three influenza pandemics occurred, each caused by the appearance of a new strain of the virus in humans, and killed tens of millions of people. Often, new influenza strains appear when an existing flu virus spreads to humans from another animal species, or when an existing human strain picks up new genes from a virus that usually infects birds or pigs. An avian strain named H5N1 raised the concern of a new influenza pandemic after it emerged in Asia in the 1990s, but it has not evolved to a form that spreads easily between people. In April 2009 a novel flu strain evolved that combined genes from human, pig, and bird flu. Initially dubbed \"swine flu\" and also known as influenza A/H1N1, it emerged in Mexico, the United States, and several other nations. The World Health Organization officially declared the outbreak to be a pandemic on 11 June 2009 (see 2009 flu pandemic). The WHO's declaration of a pandemic level 6 was an indication of spread, not severity, the strain actually having a lower mortality rate than common flu outbreaks." [Wikipedia:Influenza]

def: "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, also known as A(H5N1) or simply H5N1, is a subtype of the influenza A virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza (\"bird flu\"). It is enzootic in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is spreading globally after first appearing in Asia. It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to \"bird flu\" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain.According to the World Health Organization and United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, H5N1 pathogenicity is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination, and so far there is \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission\" of the virus. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008 in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006 and 55 in June 2007. The global HPAI situation significantly improved in the first half of 2008, but the FAO reports that imperfect disease surveillance systems mean that occurrence of the virus remains underestimated and underreported. In July 2013 the WHO announced a total of 630 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 375 people since 2003.Several H5N1 vaccines have been developed and approved, and stockpiled by a number of countries, including the United States (in its National Stockpile), Britain, France, Canada, and Australia, for use in an emergency.Research has shown that a highly contagious strain of H5N1, one that might allow airborne transmission between mammals, can be reached in only a few mutations, raising concerns about a pandemic and bioterrorism."

They are most commonly seen in dogs. Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Boston Terriers are the most commonly affected breeds. Iris cysts also occur in cats and horses.

Golden Retrievers may have a higher rate of glaucoma associated with iris cysts.Iris cysts need to be differentiated from iris melanoma, a tumor, by demonstrating their hollowness. A light directed at an iris cyst will cause it to transilluminate. Iris cysts can be collapsed if necessary by a veterinarian with a small needle carefully introduced into the anterior chamber.

def: "Jaagsiekte (yaag·zeek·te) is a chronic and contagious disease of the lungs in sheep and goats first described in 1865. Its name derives from Afrikaans and means \"Chasing Sickness\" such that animals afflicted with the disease are in respiratory distress as if they are out of breath from being chased. It is also referred to as Ovine Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma (OPA). During end-stage disease, animals exude a foamy white fluid from the nose which is thought to be the mode of transmission between animals. Dissected lungs from afflicted sheep are interspersed with multifocal tumors. Some of these are small discrete nodules and others will involve the entire half of a lung lobule. The disease is caused by a retrovirus called the Jaagsiekte Sheep Retrovirus (JSRV) that acutely transforms the lung epithelia into cancerous cells. Specifically, Type-2 pneumocytes and Clara Cells of the lung are the likely target for JSRV transformation. The tumors formed there exhibit the overactive secretory functions which are a hallmark of OPA.OPA is an infectious disease of sheep and recently has been used as an animal model for human lung cancer. It is common in the UK and in South Africa. The disease has a long incubation period and is not seen until sheep reach at least 2 years of age. Clinical symptoms include weight loss, loss of appetite, and respiratory difficulty which is associated with obvious movement of the abdomen and high pitched noises. Fluid accumulates in the respiratory tract and the disease ultimately causes death. The retroviral antigen levels of JSRV are very high in OPA tumors and can be detected in the lung secretions of infected sheep. A common field assessment for Jaagsiekte is the \"wheelbarrow test\" where one lifts the hind legs of the animal above the head to observe lung exudate flow out the nose and mouth. This fluid contains infectious JSRV. It is thought that infected animals secrete the virus before showing clinical symptoms and the virus is therefore easily spread within flocks. The disease is histologically similar to human bronchioalveolar carcinoma which accounts for approximately 25% of all diagnosed human lung cancers.Dolly the sheep, the first mammal successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell, was euthanized after it was confirmed that she had Jaagsiekte."

def: "Laryngeal paralysis in animals is a condition in which the nerves and muscles that control the movements of one or both arytenoid cartilages of the larynx cease to function, and instead of opening during inspiration and closing during swallowing, the arytenoids remain stationary in a somewhat neutral position. Specifically, the muscle that causes abduction of the arytenoid cartilage, the cricoarytenoideus dorsalis muscle, ceases to function. This leads to inadequate ventilation during exercise and during thermoregulatory panting as well as incomplete protection of the airway during swallowing. Affected animals thus have reduced tolerance for exercise and heat and an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia. Laryngeal paralysis is fairly common in large breed dogs and is rarely found in cats. It can also occur in horses where it is referred to as roaring, roarer's syndrome, or medically as laryngeal hemiplegia or recurrent laryngeal neuropathy (RLN). Laryngeal paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral depending upon dysfunction of one or both arytenoid cartilages." [Wikipedia:Laryngeal_paralysis]

def: "Legg–Calvé–Perthes Disease (/ˈlɛɡ.kælˈveɪ.ˈpɜrtiz/, /ˈlɛɡ.kɑːlˈveɪ.ˈpɜrtɨz/) is a childhood hip disorder initiated by a disruption of blood flow to the ball of the femur called the femoral head. Due to the lack of blood flow, the bone dies (osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis) and stops growing. Over time, healing occurs by new blood vessels infiltrating the dead bone and removing the necrotic bone which leads to a loss of bone mass and a weakening of the femoral head. The bone loss leads to some degree of collapse and deformity of the femoral head and sometimes secondary changes to the shape of the hip socket. It is also referred to as idiopathic avascular osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head since the cause of the interruption of the blood supply of the head of the femur in the hip joint is unknown. The disease is most commonly found in children between the ages of 4 to 8 but it can occur in children between the ages of 2 to 15. The main long-term problem with this condition is that it can produce a permanent deformity of the femoral head which increases the risk of developing osteoarthritis in adults. It is also known as Perthes Disease, Legg–Perthes Disease, or Legg–Calve-Perthes Disease (LCPD). Because Perthes' disease is associated with certain clinical features such as more common in boys, hyperactivity, small stature for age, delayed bone age, and some minor congenital anomalies, some call this Legg–Calvé–Perthes Syndrome to emphasize that the disease process may not be isolated to the hip joint only.It is named for Arthur Legg (1874-1939), an American Orthopedic Surgeon, Jacques Calvé (1875-1954), French Orthopedic Surgeon, and Georg Perthes, German Orthopedic Surgeon. and was first described by Karel Maydl[citation needed]."

def: "Leptospirosis (also known as field fever, rat catcher's yellows, and pretibial fever among others names) is an infection caused by bacteria of the Leptospira type. Symptoms can range from none to mild such as headaches, muscles pains, and fevers to severe with bleeding from the lungs or meningitis. If the infection causes the person to turn yellow, have kidney failure and bleeding it is then known as Weil's disease. If it causes lots of bleeding from the lungs it is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome.There are ten different types of Leptospira that cause disease in humans. It is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals. The most common animals that spread the disease are rodents. It is often transmitted by animal urine or water containing animal urine coming into contact with breaks in the skin, the eyes, mouth, nose or vagina. In the developing world the disease most commonly occurs in farmers and poor people who live in cities. In the developed world it most commonly occurs in those involved in outdoor activities in warm and wet areas of the world. Diagnosis is by growing the bacteria from a blood sample, finding its DNA in the blood, or looking for antibodies against the infection.Efforts to prevent the disease include protective equipment to prevent contact when working with potentially infected animals, washing after this contact, and reducing rodents in areas people live and work. The antibiotic, doxycycline when used in an effort to prevent infection among travellers is of unclear benefit. Vaccines for animals exist for certain type of Leptospira which may decrease the risk of spread to humans. Treatment if infected is with antibiotics such as: doxycycline, penicillin, or ceftriaxone. Severe causes may result in rates of death greater than 50%.It is estimated that seven to ten million people are infected by leptospirosis a year. The number of deaths this causes is not clear. The disease is most common in tropical areas of the world but may occur anywhere. Outbreaks may occur in slums of the developing world. The disease was first described by Weil in 1886 in Germany. Animals who are infected may have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may vary by the type of animal." [Wikipedia:Leptospirosis]

def: "Lethal white syndrome (LWS), also called overo lethal white syndrome (OLWS), lethal white overo (LWO), and overo lethal white foal syndrome (OLWFS), is an autosomal genetic disorder most prevalent in the American Paint Horse. Affected foals are born after the full 11-month gestation and externally appear normal, though they have all-white or nearly all-white coats and blue eyes. However, internally, these foals have a nonfunctioning colon. Within a few hours, signs of colic appear and affected foals die within a few days. Because the death is often painful, such foals often are humanely euthanized once identified. The disease is particularly devastating because foals are born seemingly healthy after being carried to full term.The disease has a similar etiology to Hirschsprung's disease in humans. A mutation in the middle of the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) gene causes lethal white syndrome when homozygous. Carriers, who are heterozygous, that is, have one copy of the mutated allele, but themselves are healthy, can now be reliably identified with a DNA test. Both parents must be carriers of one copy of the LWS allele in order for an affected foal to be born.Horses that are heterozygous for the gene that causes lethal white syndrome often exhibit a spotted coat color pattern commonly known as \"frame\" or \"frame overo.\" Coat color alone does not always indicate the presence of LWS or carrier status, however. The frame pattern may be minimally expressed or masked by other spotting patterns. There also are different genetic mechanisms which produce healthy white foals and have no connection to LWS; another reason for genetic testing of potential breeding stock. Though there is no treatment or cure for LWS foals, a white foal without LWS that appears ill may have a treatable condition." [Wikipedia:Lethal_white_syndrome]

The dog's incessant licking of the lesion eventually results in a thickened, firm, oval plaque.The most common cause of lick granuloma appears to be psychological, related to stress, anxiety, separation anxiety, boredom, or compulsiveness. Lick granulomas are especially seen in active dogs left alone for long periods of time. One theory is that excessive licking causes endorphin release, which reduces pain and makes the dog feel euphoric temporarily; that effect then causes an addiction to licking.Treatment of the primary cause, if known, is essential. In psychogenic cases, psychological factors should be identified and addressed, such as being left alone all day, being confined, and changes in the household." [Wikipedia:Lick_granuloma]

Several scientific articles have recently reported findings indicating that the Ljungan virus is associated with malformations, intrauterine fetal death, and sudden infant death in humans. In addition, studies are being conducted worldwide to investigate the possible connection of the virus to diabetes, neurological and other illnesses in humans.The Ljungan virus belongs to the Parechovirus genus of the Picornavirus family. Other members of this viral family include Polio virus, hepatitis A, and the viruses causing the common cold (rhino virus). One of the earliest scientific discoveries regarding the Ljungan virus was that infected wild rodents developed diabetes if they were exposed to stress. This has led to speculation that this disease may be the underlying cause of fluctuating rodent populations in Scandinavia; when rodents increase to high densities, they find it difficult to defend territory and obtain food, and then become more susceptible to predation. This stressful situation results in disease, death and population decline, leading to a pattern of cyclic variation in population size over time." [Wikipedia:Ljungan_virus]

def: "The M74 syndrome is a reproduction disorder of salmon (Salmo salar) feeding in the Baltic Sea. M74 manifests as offspring mortality during the yolk-sac fry phase. Before dying, the yolk-sac fry display typical symptoms.Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency in eggs is the immediate cause of M74 mortality. The deficiency can be prevented by thiamine treatments.The thiamine deficiency syndrome M74 is related to the fat and thiamine content of prey fish. The diet of Baltic salmon leads to thiamine deficiency in eggs and consequently to the mortality of yolk-sac fry: The main prey species of the Baltic salmon are sprat (Sprattus sprattus) and herring (Clupea harangus membras). Average fat content is greater in sprat than in herring. The fat content is highest and the thiamine concentration is lowest in the youngest sprat. The need for thiamine depends on the amount of fat in the diet. Thiamine deficiency in eggs results from an unbalanced diet abundant in fatty prey fish, such as young sprat, from which the supply of thiamine is insufficient in proportion to the supply of energy and unsaturated fatty acids for salmon.Relationships between fish stock changes in the Baltic Sea and the M74 syndrome: The M74 syndrome is connected to a weak Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) stock and strong year classes of sprat in the Baltic Sea. Since the collapse, heavy fishing mortality as well as predation on cod eggs by sprat and food competition between sprat and young-of-the-year cod has inhibited cod recovery. Coincidentally with the decline in the cod stock since 1982, and following the consequent reduction in predation pressure, the sprat stock increased rapidly, and salmon therefore had more food. Salmon grew faster, resulting also in a high CF.Briefly: Plentiful fatty sprat as prey for salmon leads to reproduction disorder" [Wikipedia:M74_syndrome]

There are many differences between mammary tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options. The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, mammary tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in female dogs with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Multiple studies have documented that spaying bitches when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged. Compared with bitches left intact, those spayed before puberty have 0.5% of the risk, those spayed after one estrous cycle have 8.0% of the risk, and dogs spayed after two estrous cycles have 26.0% of the risk of developing mammary neoplasia later in life. Overall, unspayed bitches have a seven times greater risk of developing mammary neoplasia than do those that are spayed. While the benefit of spaying decreases with each estrous cycle, some benefit has been demonstrated in bitches even up to 9 years of age. There is a much lower risk (about 1 percent) in male dogs and a risk in cats about half that of dogs." [Wikipedia:Mammary_tumor]

Thus, mange includes mite-associated skin disease in domestic animals (cats and dogs), in livestock (such as sheep scab), and in wild animals (for example, coyotes, cougars, and bears). Since mites belong to the arachnid subclass Acari (also called Acarina), another term for mite infestation is acariasis. Parasitic mites that cause mange in mammals embed themselves either in skin or hair follicles in the animal, depending upon their genus. Sarcoptes spp. burrow into skin, while Demodex spp. live in follicles.In humans, these two types of mite infections, which would otherwise be known as \"mange\" in furry mammals, are instead known, respectively, as scabies and demodicosis.

name: mare reproductive loss syndrome
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS) is a syndrome consisting of equine abortions and three related nonreproductive syndromes which occur in horses of all breeds, sexes, and ages. MRLS was first observed in the U.S. state of Kentucky in a three-week period around May 5, 2001, when about 20% to 30% of Kentucky's pregnant mares suffered abortions. A primary infectious cause was rapidly ruled out, and the search began for a candidate toxin. No abortifacient toxins were identified. In the spring of 2001 Kentucky had experienced an extraordinarily heavy infestation of eastern tent caterpillars (ETC). An epidemiological study showed ETC to be associated with MRLS. When ETC returned to Kentucky in the spring of 2002 it was immediately shown that equine exposure to caterpillars produced abortions. Research then focused on how the ETCs produced the abortions. Reviewing the speed with which ETCs produced late term abortions in 2002 experiments, the non-specific bacterial infections in the placenta/fetus were assigned a primary driving role. The question then became how exposure to the caterpillars produced these non-specific bacterial infections of the affected placenta/fetus and also the uveitis and pericarditis cases. Reviewing the barbed nature of ETC hairs (setae) it was noted that intestinal blood vessel penetration by barbed setal fragments would introduce barbed setal fragments and associated bacterial contaminants into intestinal collecting blood vessels (septic penetrating setae). Distribution of these materials following cardiac output would deliver these materials to all tissues in the body (septic penetrating setal emboli). About 15% of cardiac output goes to the late term fetus, at which point the septic barbed setal fragments are positioned to penetrate placental tissues which lack an immune response. Bacterial proliferation, therefore, proceeds unchecked and the late term fetus is rapidly aborted. Similar events occur with the early term fetus, but as a much smaller target receiving an equivalently smaller fraction of cardiac output, the early term fetus is less likely to be \"hit\" by a randomly distributing setal fragment. Since this MRLS pathogenesis model was first proposed in 2002 other caterpillar-related abortion syndromes have been recognized, most notably Equine Amnionitis and Fetal Loss (EAFL) in Australia, and more recently, a long-recognized relationship between pregnant camels eating caterpillars and abortions (\"everybody knows\") among the camel pastoralists in the Western Sahara."

The disease is characterized by the presence of T cell lymphoma as well as infiltration of nerves and organs by lymphocytes. Viruses related to MDV appear to be benign and can be used as vaccine strains to prevent Marek's disease. For example, the related Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT), causes no apparent disease in turkeys and continues to be used as a vaccine strain for prevention of Marek's disease (see below). Birds infected with GaHV-2 can be carriers and shedders of the virus for life. Newborn chicks are protected by maternal antibodies for a few weeks. After infection, microscopic lesions are present after one to two weeks, and gross lesions are present after three to four weeks.

def: "Masticatory muscle myositis (MMM) is an inflammatory disease in dogs affecting the muscles of mastication (chewing). It is also known as atrophic myositis or eosinophilic myositis. MMM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in dogs. The disease mainly affects large breed dogs. German Shepherd Dogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed. There is a similar disease of the eye muscles found in Golden Retrievers. Symptoms of acute MMM include swelling of the jaw muscles, drooling, and pain on opening the mouth. Ophthalmic signs may include third eyelid protrusion, red eyes, and exophthalmos (protruding eyeballs). In chronic MMM there is atrophy of the jaw muscles, and scarring of the masticatory muscles due to fibrosis may result in inability to open the mouth (trismus). The affected muscles include the temporalis, masseter, and pterygoid muscles. The disease is usually bilateral.MMM is caused by the presence of 2M fibers in the muscles of the jaw. 2M fibers are not found elsewhere in the body, but they are close in structure to proteins found on the surface of bacteria. The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in inflammation. Diagnosis of MMM is through either biopsy of the temporalis or masseter muscles or the 2M antibody assay, in which blood serum of the possible MMM-dog is reacted with temporalis tissue of a normal dog, or both. False negatives by the 2M antibody assay may be obtained if MMM is end-stage with destruction of type 2M fibers and marked fibrosis. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids such as prednisone, often with decreasing doses for up to 4–6 months, and in the case of trismus, manual opening of the mouth under anesthesia. Feeding very soft or liquid food during this time is usually necessary. The ultimate degree of recovery of jaw function and muscle mass will depend upon the extent of damage to the muscle tissue. Recurrence of MMM may occur. Misdiagnosis of MMM as a retroorbital abscess based on physical examination and finding of trismus leads to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, which will not impede the progress of MMM."

name: megaesophagus
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Megaesophagus (also known as ME) is a condition in humans, cats and dogs where peristalsis fails to occur properly and the esophagus is enlarged. Normally, when the animal's esophagus is functioning properly, it acts as a muscle and pushes the food down the esophagus into the stomach. However, when an animal has megaesophagus, the esophagus stays enlarged and does not push the food down to the stomach. Therefore, the food fails to enter the stomach and often stays in the esophagus, and is eventually regurgitated, or enters the lungs through breathing, or decays in the esophagus.In human pathology a condition known as achalasia may predispose a person to slowly develop megaesophagus. Achalasia is due to the loss of ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus. It occurs mostly in middle aged adults. There is a marked lack of contraction within the muscles involved in peristalsis with a constant contraction of the lower esophageal sphincter. Dilation of the esophagus results in difficulty swallowing. Retention of food bolus is also noted. Chagas disease is one cause of megaesophagus in humans. Achalasia also predisposes to esophageal carcinoma.Megaesophagus can also be a symptom of another disease in dogs called myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disease where the primary symptom is weakness in various body parts of the dog. However, when myasthenia gravis occurs in older dogs it is thought of as an immune-mediated disease. Often when myasthenia gravis is diagnosed in older dogs the first symptom the dog may manifest is megaesophagus.Myasthenia gravis occurs when acetylcholine receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine receptors or AChRs) fail to function properly. Due to the inability of the nerve receptors to function appropriately, the muscles fail to have a stimulus that causes them to contract.An important distinction in recognizing megaesophagus is the difference between when a dog regurgitates or vomits. Regurgitating is a common symptom of megaesophagus while vomiting is not necessarily associated with megaesophagus. When a dog regurgitates there is usually not as much effort involved as when a dog vomits. Often when regurgitating, the dog will tip its head down and the liquid and/or food will almost appear to \"spill out\" of its throat. Also another side when the dog regurgitates, the food is tube shape.One of the primary dangers to a dog with megaesophagus is aspiration pneumonia. Because the food stays lodged in the throat, it can often be inhaled into the lungs causing aspiration pneumonia. One way to avoid this is to make sure that every time the dog eats or drinks anything, that the dog sits for at least 10 minutes afterwards or is held in a sitting up or begging position. This requires that all food and liquid intake be closely monitored and specifically administered to the dog in regular intervals (sometimes as often as 2–3 hours) in smaller quantities. Obviously, if smaller quantities of food and water are administered, one needs to take the necessary precaution to ensure the dog has a sufficient caloric and water intake. According to many specialists, this disorder has a guarded prognosis, however, since 2004 many owners have found a number of successful management techniques, one of which is vertical feeding (see \"Bailey Chair megaesophagus\")."

Amongst domestic animals, metritis and endometritis are most common in cattle after parturition, and the diseases are often called postpartum metritis or postpartum endometritis. These diseases in cattle are caused by bacteria and occasionally viruses. The most common bacteria that cause postpartum metritis and endometritis in cattle are Escherichia coli, Trueperella (previously Arcanobacterium) pyogenes and anaerobic bacteria such as Prevotella species and Fusobacterium necrophorum. The virus most consistently associated with postpartum uterine disease in cattle is Bovine Herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4). In addition, \"Several specific diseases are associated with metritis or endometritis. These include brucellosis, leptospirosis, campylobacteriosis, and trichomoniasis\" In cattle, bacterial infection of the uterus affects almost all animals after parturition. Of course this doesn't mean they will get disease. In fact beef cattle rarely have disease unless they have a predisposing factor such as retained placenta or difficult parturition. However, uterine disease is common in dairy cattle - particularly high-milk-yield cows such as Holstein-Friesian cows.Clinical definitions of endometritis and metritisMetritis occurs within 21 days and is most common within 10 days of parturition. Metritis is characterized by an enlarged uterus and a watery red-brown fluid to viscous off-white purulent uterine discharge, which often has a fetid odour. The severity of disease is categorized by the signs of health:Grade 1 metritis: An abnormally enlarged uterus and a purulent uterine discharge without any systemic signs of ill health. Grade 2 metritis: Animals with additional signs of systemic illness such as decreased milk yield, dullness, and fever >39.5°C. Grade 3 metritis: Animals with signs of toxemia such as inappetence, cold extremities, depression, and/or collapse.Clinical endometritis is defined in cattle as the presence of a purulent uterine discharge detectable in the vagina 21 days or more postpartum. Simple grading systems for clinical disease are based on the character of the vaginal mucus and typical Grading schemes for clinical endometritis are widely used by veterinarians.Subclinical endometritis is characterized by inflammation of the endometrium and the presence of neutrophils in cytology or biopsy histology, in the absence of signs of clinical endometritis."

It is most common in the first few days of lactation, when demand for calcium for milk production exceeds the body's ability to mobilize calcium reserves. \"Fever\" is a misnomer, as body temperature during the disease is usually below normal. Low blood calcium levels interfere with muscle function throughout the body, causing general weakness, loss of appetite, and eventually heart failure. Hypocalcemia is more common in older animals (which have reduced ability to mobilize calcium from bone) and in certain breeds (such as Jersey cattle). Hypocalcemia, like milk fever, occurs occasionally at any time during the lactation or pregnancy and in many mammalian species." [Wikipedia:Milk_fever]

The virus replicates in the cells of the crypt epithelium in the duodenum and jejunum and, to a lesser extent the ileum, colon and caecum. The severity of the disease is directly related to necrosis of the crypt epithelium. Virus enteritis of mink was recognized first in 1947 when epizootics occurred among ranch mink in southern Canada.

def: "Murrain /ˈmɜrɪn/ is an antiquated term for various infectious diseases affecting cattle and sheep. It literally means \"death\" and was used in medieval times to represent just that. The population of that era had no way of identifying specific diseases in their livestock so they simply put all illnesses under one heading.[citation needed] Murrain does not refer to any specific disease but was an umbrella term for a number of different diseases, including rinderpest, erysipelas, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, and streptococcus infections. Some of the diseases could also affect humans. The term murrain was also used generally to refer to an epidemic of such a disease. There were major sheep and cattle murrains in Europe during the 14th century, which combined with the Little Ice Age resulted in widespread famine during the Great Famine of 1315-1317, weakening the population of Europe before the onset of the Black Death in 1348.The term murrain is also used in some Bible translations relating to the fifth plague brought upon Egypt.Exodus 9:3: \"Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain.\"\"Pestilence\", which is mentioned 47 times in 46 verses of the Bible, can be translated \"murrain\" by Christian apologists.[Enhanced Strong’s Lexicon].see Psalms 91:3 KJVThe word in Hebrew is דֶּבֶר \"dever\" (Strong's # 01698), derived from the primitive root \"dabar\" in the sense of \"to destroy.\"In some parts of Scotland, force-fire was believed to cure it and in some remote regions of Cumbria, England, murrain is still used as a term for a curse, specifically a curse placed upon land or livestock. It is believed that the medieval term has, by a process of syncreticism become synonymous with witchcraft. This usage inspired the ATV television play, Murrain, written by Nigel Kneale, which was broadcast on 27 July 1975 as part of the channel's Against the Crowd drama strand." [Wikipedia:Murrain]

Although flies are most commonly attracted to open wounds and urine- or feces-soaked fur, some species (including the most common myiatic flies, the botfly, blowfly and screwfly) can create an infestation even on unbroken skin and have even been known to use moist soil and non-myiatic flies (such as the common housefly) as vector agents for their parasitic larvae.Colloquialisms for myiasis include flystrike and blowfly strike, and the victim or the tissue may be described as fly-blown. The name of the condition derives from ancient Greek μυῖα (myia), meaning \"fly\".Because some animals (particularly domestic animals) cannot react as effectively as humans to the causes and effects of myiasis, such infestations present a severe and continuing problem for livestock industries worldwide, causing severe economic losses where they are not mitigated by human action. Although typically a far greater issue for animals, myiasis is also a relatively frequent affliction of humans in rural tropical regions where myiatic flies thrive, and often may require medical attention to surgically remove the parasites.Myiasis varies widely in the forms it takes and its effects on the victims. Such variations depend largely on the fly species and where the larvae are located. Some flies lay eggs in open wounds, other larvae may invade unbroken skin or enter the body through the nose or ears, and still others may be swallowed if the eggs are deposited on the lips or on food."

In particular, the parasite is a food-borne intestinal trematode prevalent in the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The life cycle of the N. salmincola requires three hosts. The first intermediate host is an Oxytrema silicula stream snail. The second intermediate host is a salmonid fish, though some non-salmonid fishes also play a role. Lastly, the definitive host is most commonly a canid, though many other mammals are also definitive hosts, including humans. Transmission of N. salmincola to the definitive host occurs upon ingestion of parasite-infected fish. The parasite is most known for its association with “salmon poisoning disease\", which, left untreated, proves to be fatal to dogs and other canids. However, canids are affected by the Neorickettsia helminthoeca bacteria, for which N. salmincola acts as a vector, and not by the parasite itself. Very few known cases of naturally acquired human infection with N. salmincola are found in the literature, though it is likely that many cases are unreported, since most people are asymptomatic, or symptomatic with non-specific symptoms like gastrointestinal discomfort. Disease caused by N. salmincola, or nanophyetiasis, is easily preventable by thoroughly cooking fish before consumption. There are no known cases of human infection by the Rickettsia bacteria carried by N. salmincola.A subspecific parasite, Nanophyetus schikhobalowi, is endemic to Siberia, where human cases of nanophyetiasis have been reported in scientific literature since 1931."

It is not very well researched yet, but generally assumed to be caused by a bacterial infection.NHP mainly affects the farmed shrimp species Litopenaeus vannamei (Pacific white shrimp) and Litopenaeus stylirostris (Western blue shrimp), but has also been reported in three other American species, namely Farfantepenaeus aztecus, Farfantepenaeus californiensis, and Litopenaeus setiferus. The highest mortality rates occur in L. vannamei, which is one of the two most frequently farmed species of shrimp. Untreated, the disease causes mortality rates of up to 90% within 30 days. A first outbreak of NHP had been reported in Texas in 1985; the disease then spread to shrimp aquacultures in South America, in 2009 to China and subsequently Southeast Asia, followed by massive outbreaks in that region in 2012/13.NHP is associated with a small, gram-negative, and highly pleomorphic Rickettsia-like bacterium that belongs to its own, new genus in the alpha proteobacteria. However, in early 2013 a novel strain of Vibrio parahaemolyticus was identified as a more likely causative agent, though involvement of a virus cannot be definitely ruled out yet.Infected shrimps show gross signs including soft shells and flaccid bodies, black or darkened gills, dark edges of the pleopods and uropods, and an atrophied hepatopancreas that is whitish instead of orange or tan as is usual.Whichever of the two bacteria associated with NHP actually causes it, the pathogen seems to prefer high water temperatures (above 29 °C or 84 °F) and elevated levels of salinity (more than 20–38 ppt). Avoiding such conditions in shrimp ponds is thus an important disease control measure." [Wikipedia:Necrotising_hepatopancreatitis]

In cats, the antibodies are already present in the queen's blood before parturition. The blood group antigens are similar in structure to the antigen of a common bacteria in the gut of cats leading to antibody formation. In horses, these antibodies are formed when there is mixing of maternal and fetal blood, normally during parturition, leaving only subsequent foals at risk. The condition in horses is similar to hemolytic disease of the newborn in humans. In both cases, immunoglobulins are produced in the colostrum. During the first 24 hours of the neonate's life its gut absorbs all of the mother's antibodies that are passed in colostrum. Kittens and foals obtain the majority of their immune response from the colostrum. They are not born with a strong immune response. When they absorb the mother's antibodies against their blood type it causes lysis of the red blood cells leading to anemia. Symptoms include lethargy, pale mucus membranes, and blood in the urine.In the kitten this is referred to as fading kitten syndrome.Animals suffering from this disease must be taken to a veterinarian immediately. If not taken to a vet within 6 hours, the kitten will have no chance of survival unless with aggressive intensive care. The owner should take the kitten and mother to a Vet Emergency Hospital immediately.Blood typing can be performed before breeding and parturition to determine if this will be a problem."

Its effects are most notable in domestic poultry due to their high susceptibility and the potential for severe impacts of an epizootic on the poultry industries. It is endemic to many countries.Exposure of humans to infected birds (for example in poultry processing plants) can cause mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms, but the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) otherwise poses no hazard to human health. Interest in the use of NDV as an anticancer agent has arisen from the ability of NDV to selectively kill human tumour cells with limited toxicity to normal cells.No treatment for NDV exists, but the use of prophylactic vaccines and sanitary measures reduces the likelihood of outbreaks."

The expected protein encoded by the NV gene is not found in the virions, leading to its being named a \"nonvirion\" (NV) protein. This is the origin of the genus name Novirhabdovirus.The four recognized species of the genus are Hirame rhabdovirus, currently isolated to Japan, Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), enozootic to North America but now present in Europe and Asia, as well, Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV), enzootic to Europe, but now present in North America and Asia, as well, and snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV). Two tentative species of the genus, identified the Seventh Report of the ICTV, are eel virus B12 (EEV-B12), and eel virus C26 (EEV-C26)." [Wikipedia:Novirhabdovirus]

The disease is caused by an increase of melanocytes in the iris, choroid, and surrounding structures. Overproduction of pigment by these cells can block the trabecular meshwork through which fluid drains from the eye. The increased fluid in the eye leads to increased pressure, which can lead to glaucoma. In humans, this is sometimes known as pigment dispersion syndrome." [Wikipedia:Ocular_melanosis]

name: osteochondritis dissecans
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Osteochondritis dissecans /ˌɒsti.oʊkɒnˈdraɪtɪs ˈdɪsɨkænz/, often abbreviated to OCD or OD, is a joint disorder in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD is caused by blood deprivation in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone to die in a process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the articular cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these osteochondral fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage.In humans OCD is a rare disease, occurring in only 15 to 30 people per 100,000 in the general population each year. Although rare, it is an important cause of joint pain in physically active adolescents. Because their bones are still growing, adolescents are more likely than adults to recover from OCD; recovery in adolescents can be attributed to the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. While OCD may affect any joint, the knee tends to be the most commonly affected, and constitutes 75% of all cases. OCD is also a growing concern, especially amongst women, in rural areas of Nigeria, according to research done by the University of Port Harcourt. This is due to the chemical pollution of primary sources of water used for drinking and irrigation in the area.OCD also is found in animals, and is of particular concern in horses, as there may be a hereditary component in some horse breeds. Feeding for forced growth and selective breeding for increased size are also factors. OCD has also been studied in other animals—mainly dogs, especially the German Shepherd—where it is a common primary cause of elbow dysplasia in medium-large breeds.OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and crepitus. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. OCD is classified by these imaging techniques, or by arthroscopy of the joint, and represented in stages (I, II, III and IV) of disease progression. Following diagnosis the problem may be treated, depending on its severity, by repairing the cartilage. Non-surgical treatment is rarely an option as the capacity for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing) and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment varies widely and includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement.Post-operative rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine protection of the joint's cartilage surface and underlying subchondral bone with maintenance of muscle strength and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle lost to atrophy without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. Post-operative pain killers, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain during recovery.Franz König coined the term osteochondritis dissecans in 1887, describing it as an inflammation of the bone–cartilage interface. Many other conditions were once confused with OCD when attempting to describe how the disease affected the joint, including osteochondral fracture, osteonecrosis, accessory ossification center, osteochondrosis, and hereditary epiphyseal dysplasia. Some authors have used the terms osteochondrosis dissecans and osteochondral fragments as synonyms for OCD." [Wikipedia:Osteochondritis_dissecans]

The external ear in animals is longer and deeper than in humans, which makes it easier for infection or wax to build up or be hard to remove. Complete ear canal inspection requires the use of an otoscope by a veterinarian.Infections are usually secondary to inflammation or to improper grooming techniques. Infections can be caused by both bacterial and fungal origin, as well as small organisms such as ear mites. Malassezia pachydermatis is a common fungal agent for ear infections in dogs.

It manifests with sudden, otherwise unexplained pain and lameness sometimes shifting from leg to leg, usually between 5 and 14 months of age. Signs such as fever and weight loss, and symptoms such as anorexia, and lethargy can also be seen. The cause is unknown, but genetics, stress, infection, metabolism, or an autoimmune component may be factors. It has also been suggested that rapid growth and high-protein food are involved in the pathogenesis.Panosteitis is characterized histologically by an increase in activity of osteoblasts and fibroblasts in the periosteum, endosteum and bone marrow, resulting in fibrosis and the formation of connective tissue in the medullary cavity of the affected bone. Pain may be caused by increased pressure in the medullary cavity and the stimulation of pain receptors in the periosteum.The humerus is most commonly affected. Males are more commonly affected than females. Diagnosis is made by pain on palpation of the long bones of the limbs. X-rays may show an increased density in the medullary cavity of the affected bones, often near the nutrient foramen (where the blood vessels enter the bone). This evidence may not be present for up to ten days after lameness begins. Pain medication and exercise restriction can help to relieve the symptoms, and the lameness usually goes away after days to weeks without additional treatment. Recurrences up to the age of two years may occur. Larger breeds, such as German Shepherd Dogs, Golden Retrievers, Basset Hounds, Dobermanns, Labrador Retrievers, and Rottweilers, are more prone to this problem. There has been one suspected case of panosteitis in a fast-growing six-month-old camel with a shifting leg lameness.Panosteitis is also referred to as eosinophilic panosteitis, enostosis, endosteal proliferation of new bone, and eopan."

It is most commonly seen in intact (not neutered) dogs and is the third most common tumor type in intact male dogs.

Perianal gland adenomas are three times more likely to be found in intact male dogs than females, and perianal gland adenocarcinomas are ten times more common in male dogs than females. The most commonly affected breeds for adenomas are the Siberian Husky, Cocker Spaniel, Pekingese, and Samoyed; for adenocarcinomas the most commonly affected breeds are the Siberian Husky, Bulldog, and Alaskan Malamute.Perianal gland tumors are located most commonly in the skin around the anus, but can also be found on the tail or groin. Adenomas are more common, making up 91 percent of perianal gland tumors in one study. Adenomas and adenocarcinomas look alike, both being round, pink and usually less than three centimeters in width. Adenocarcinomas are more likely to be multiple and invasive into the underlying tissue, and they can metastasize to the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs.Both types should be removed and sent to a pathologist for identification. However, 95 percent of perianal gland adenomas will disappear after neutering the dog. Removing the tumor and neutering the dog at the same time will help prevent recurrence. Dogs with perianal gland adenocarcinomas should be treated with aggressive surgery and the radiation therapy and chemotherapy if necessary." [Wikipedia:Perianal_gland_tumor]

Another Morbillivirus caused the deaths of Baikal seals (Phoca sibirica) in Lake Baikal, Siberia. This was later identified as a strain of the closely related canine distemper virus (CDV) and was probably transmitted to the seals from terrestrial animals, CDV being widespread in canines in the Lake Baikal region.The third outbreak occurred in harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) near the British Isles and the Netherlands. A third Morbillivirus, named porpoise morbillivirus was identified as the cause.In 2002, an epidemic of PDV along the North Sea coast resulted in the deaths of 21,700 seals, estimated to be 51% of the population.Antibodies to PDV and CDV have been found in a number of carnivorous mammal species in Canada, including polar bears, indicating the potential for the viruses to spread to new species.The suddenness of the emergence of PDV and related viruses in aquatic mammals has implicated environmental changes as the cause. Pollutants have been posited as contributors by interfering with the ability of animals to mount a defense against infection. Alternatively, climate change and overfishing may have forced aquatic species that naturally harbour the viruses into new areas, exposing immunologically susceptible populations."

It is also called cerebrocortical necrosis (CCN), laminar cortical necrosis or cortical necrosis. PEM is a sporadic disease of unknown cause occurring in cattle, sheep and goats. PEM is most commonly seen in cattle at 6–18 months of age when fed concentrate rations. Sheep are usually affected at 2–7 months of age. The lesion is associated with thiamine deficiency or a disturbance in thiamine metabolism. Ruminants are supplied with thiamine by synthetic activity of ruminal bacteria. PEM most commonly develops in cattle fed carbohydrate-rich and roughage-poor rations, which leads to subclinical lactic acidosis, and hence an alteration in ruminal microflora. Other mechanisms for disturbances in thiamine deficiency include:- Destruction of thiamine within the gastrointestinal tract (for example by thiaminases in bracken fern)- Inactivation of thiamine by excess sulfates or sulfides or elemental sulfur- Production of inactive thiamine analogues- Decreased thiamine absorption- Increased faecal excretion of thiamineInfection with Trypanosoma congolense can also cause focal PEM in the final stages of disease, likely due to ischemia from accumulation of parasites in the terminal capillaries of the brain.Clinical signs of PEM are variable depending on the area of the cerebral cortex affected and may include head pressing, dullness, opisthotonos, central blindness, anorexia, muscle tremors, teeth grinding, trismus, salivation, drooling, convulsions, nystagmus, clonic convulsions, and recumbency. Early administration of thiamine may be curative, but if the lesion is more advanced, then surviving animals may remain partially blind and mentally dull." [Wikipedia:Polioencephalomalacia]

The swelling can increase until it ruptures and drains. It can be caused by infection from Actinomyces bovis or Brucella abortus organisms, but may also occur due to parasite infestation, skin trauma, or badly fitting horse tack. Because of modern efforts to reduce the incidence of brucellosis in livestock, horses are less exposed to the Brucella abortus organism, and hence most modern cases of poll evil arise from trauma linked to a horse striking its head against poorly designed or low-clearance structures, or to improper use of equipment, particularly leaving a halter on the horse around the clock.The term has been in use since at least the 1750s. Before modern antibiotics were developed, the condition was very difficult to treat. In the 18th century, it was treated with remedies such as vinegar, wine, elder flower and even turpentine. Today, cases caught early can be cleaned with peroxide, ice packs and diluted dimethyl sulfoxide solution, with antibiotics used to prevent or slow infection. If the infection has set in and there is a discharge, antibiotic treatment along with hot packs and surgery under local anesthesia to remove infected and dead tissue is usually required.Fistulous withers is a similar condition but on the animal's withers."

PEDV cannot be transmitted to humans, nor contaminate the human food supply.It was first discovered in Europe, but has become increasingly problematic in Asian countries, such as Korea, China, Japan, the Philippines, and Thailand. It has also spread to North America: it was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2013, and in Canada in the winter of 2014. In January of 2014, a new variant strain of PEDV with three deletions, one insertion, and several mutations in S (spike) 1 region was identified in Ohio by the Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab of Ohio Department of Agriculture. PEDV has a substantial economic burden given that it is highly infectious, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality in piglets. Morbidity and mortality rates were lower for vaccinated herds than for nonvaccinated herds, which suggests the emergence of a new PEDV field strain(s) for which the current vaccine, based on the CV777 strain, was partially protective.

The virus is ubiquitous among swine throughout the world and is enzootic in most herds that have been tested. Diagnostic surveys have indicated that PPV is the major infectious cause of embryonic and fetal death.

This meat is usually rejected after inspection.This disorder is most common in Landrace, Piétrain and crossbreeds of these breeds of pig.

def: "Quittor is an infection of the lower leg of equines, sometimes known as graveling. A condition once common in draft horses, it is characterized by inflammation of the cartilage of the lower leg. There are two forms, subcutaneous and cartilaginous. Quittor usually results from an injury to the leg, such as an abscess on the coronary band above the hoof, that allows foreign matter to get into the leg and then collect beneath the hoof, leading to an infection. In some cases, removing this matter requires cutting away parts of the hoof. Abscesses may also form inside the hoof capsule itself from improper shoeing and trimming of the hoof, from laminitis, or from injury to the sole of the hoof, but the horse will be significantly lame for a longer period of time if the infection migrates up to the coronary band rather than down. Treatment of hoof and coronary band abscesses today usually incorporates use of antibiotics, sometimes combined with poulticing.Because use of draft horses has declined significantly, it is rarely encountered today. In the 1890 International Cyclopedia, it was described as \"a fistulous wound about the top of a horse's foot, and results from treads, pricks, or neglected corns, which lead to the formation of matter underneath the hoof. Any dead horn, matter, or other cause of irritation must be sought for by cutting away the hoof. A free opening must be provided for the egress of any pent-up matter. Poulticing for a few days is often useful; while healing may afterward be expedited by the injection of any mild astringent lotion.\"" [Wikipedia:Quittor]

def: "Rabies (/ˈreɪbiːz/; from Latin: rabies, \"madness\") is a viral disease that causes acute inflammation of the brain in humans and other warm-blooded animals. The time period between contracting the disease and the start of symptoms is usually one to three months; however it can vary from less than one week to more than one year. The time is dependent on the distance the virus must travel to reach the central nervous system. Early symptoms may include fever and tingling at the site of exposure. This is then followed by either violent movements, uncontrolled excitement, and fear of water or an inability to move parts of the body and confusion followed by loss of consciousness. In both cases once symptoms appear it nearly always results in death.The disease is spread to humans from another animal, commonly by a bite or scratch. Infected saliva that comes into contact with any mucous membrane is also a risk. Globally most cases are the result of a dog bite, with this being the cause in more than 90% of cases in countries where dogs commonly have rabies. In the Americas, less than 5% of cases are from dogs, with bats being the most common cause. Rodents are very rarely infected. The rabies virus travels to the brain by following the peripheral nerves. The disease can also be diagnosed after the start of symptoms.Animal control and vaccination programs have decreased the risk of rabies from dogs in a number of regions of the world. Immunizing people before they are exposed is recommended in those who are at high risk including those who work with bats or spend prolonged periods in areas of the world where the disease is common. In those who have been exposed to rabies, rabies vaccine and sometimes rabies immunoglobulin are effective in preventing disease if given before the start of symptoms. Washing bites and scratches for 15 minutes with soap and water also appears to be somewhat effective. Only a few people have survived a rabies infection and this was with extensive treatment.Rabies causes about 26,000 to 55,000 deaths worldwide per year, more than 95% of which occur in Asia and Africa. It is present in more than 150 countries and more than 3 billion people live in regions of the world where it occurs. In most of Europe and Australia rabies is only present in bats. Many small island nations are entirely rabies free." [Wikipedia:Rabies]

A 2005 study by the United States Department of Agriculture found that injuries are the second leading cause of death in horses, second only to old age. Nureyev's recovery from a broken leg while retired at stud in 1987 typifies the struggle horses have after being injured.Two years after Secretariat's recordbreaking US Triple Crown took the sport to a new level of popularity, the breakdown and death of Ruffian brought on a new era of safety concerns. Racehorses had been breaking down for centuries, but never before in an event so widely seen as the great match race between Ruffian and Foolish Pleasure at Belmont Park with 18 million viewers. The horse racing industry has been trying to adapt to the increased safety concerns ever since. \"I personally think that in a very real way, we're almost held to a higher standard because of the horses — they don't make the decision to do this.

As with megalocytiviruses, Ranavirus outbreaks are therefore of considerable economic importance in aquaculture, as epizootics can result in moderate fish loss or mass mortality events of cultured fishes. Unlike megalocytiviruses, however, Ranavirus infections in amphibians have been implicated as a contributing factor in the global decline of amphibian populations.

Most cases occur in Japan, but specific strains of the disease are present in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Africa.Some cases are diagnosed after patients were exposed to the urine or bodily secretions of an infected animal. These secretions can come from the mouth, nose, or eyes of the rodent. The majority of cases are due to the animal's bite. It can also be transmitted throughout food or water that is contaminated with rat feces or urine. Rats are not the only type of animal that can be infected with this disease. Others include weasels, gerbils, and squirrels. Household pets such as dogs or cats that are exposed to these animals can also carry the disease and infect humans.If a person is bitten by a rodent, it is important to quickly wash and cleanse the wound area thoroughly with antiseptic solution to reduce the risk of infection."

This attracted significant media attention due to the proximity of Reston to the Washington, DC metro area, and the lethality of a closely related Ebola virus. Despite its status as a level-4 organism, Reston virus is non-pathogenic to humans, though hazardous to monkeys; the perception of its lethality was confounded due to the monkey's coinfection with Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV)."

Those who have bleeding have a chance of death as high as 50%.The disease is caused by the RVF virus, which is of the Phlebovirus type. It is spread by either touching infected animal blood, breathing in the air around an infected animal being butchered, drinking raw milk from an infected animal, or the bite of infected mosquitoes. Animals such as cows, sheep, goats, and camels may be affected.In these animals it is spread mostly by mosquitoes. It does not appear that one person can infect another person. Diagnosis is by finding antibodies against the virus or the virus itself in the blood.Prevention of the disease in humans is by vaccinating animals against the disease. This must be done before an outbreak occurs as if it is done during an outbreak it may worsen the situation. Stopping the movement of animals during an outbreak may also be useful. As may decreasing mosquito numbers and avoiding their bites. There is a human vaccine; however, as of 2010 it is not widely available. Once infected there is no specific treatment.Outbreaks of the disease have only occurred in Africa and Arabia.

The disease can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages, and without prompt and appropriate treatment it can be fatal.The name “Rocky Mountain spotted fever” is something of a misnomer.

It is now recognized that this disease is broadly distributed throughout the contiguous United States, and occurs as far north as Canada and as far south as Central America and parts of South America. Between 1981 and 1996, this disease was reported from every state of the United States except for Hawaii, Vermont, Maine, and Alaska.Rocky Mountain spotted fever remains a serious and potentially life-threatening infectious disease. Despite the availability of effective treatment and advances in medical care, approximately three to five percent of patients who become ill with Rocky Mountain spotted fever die from the infection. However, effective antibiotic therapy has dramatically reduced the number of deaths caused by Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Before the discovery of tetracycline and chloramphenicol during the latter 1940s, as many as 30 percent of persons infected with R. rickettsii died." [Wikipedia:Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever]

In most cases, the illness lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment. In some cases, though, the diarrhea may be so severe, the patient becomes dangerously dehydrated and must be hospitalized.At the hospital, the patient may receive intravenous fluids to treat the dehydration, and may be given medications to provide symptomatic relief, such as fever reduction. In severe cases, the Salmonella infection may spread from the intestines to the blood stream, and then to other body sites; this is known as typhoid fever and can cause death unless the person is treated promptly with antibiotics.The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are more likely to develop severe illness. Some people afflicted with salmonellosis later experience reactive arthritis, which can have long-lasting, disabling effects. There are just two species of Salmonella, Salmonella bongori and Salmonella enterica. The latter is divided in 6 subspecies: enterica, salamae, arizonae, diazonae, houtenase and indica. These subspecies are further divided into numerous serovars. Because the serovars only differ in serotypes, and therefore in infection potential, the serovars are not italicised and are written with a capital letter as they still belong to the same subspecies. The species Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica contains over 60% of the total number of serovars and 99% of the serovars that are capable of infecting cold and warm blooded animals as well as humans. Infections are usually contracted from sources such as: Poultry, pork, beef and fish (seafood), if the meat is prepared incorrectly or is infected with the bacteria after preparation Infected eggs, egg products, and milk when not prepared, handled, or refrigerated properly Tainted fruits and vegetablesReptiles, such as turtles, lizards, and snakes, may carry Salmonella bongori (which inhabits cold-blooded animals) in their intestines which can cause intestinal infections.The most severe human Salmonella infection is caused by S. enterica supsp. enterica ser. Typhi which leads to typhoid fever; an infection that often proves fatal if not treated with the appropriate antibiotics. This serovar is restricted to humans and is usually contracted through direct contact with the fecal matter of an infected person. Typhoid fever is endemic in the developing world, where unsanitary conditions are more likely to prevail, and which can affect as many as 21.5 million people each year. Recorded cases of Typhoid fever in the developed world are mostly related to recent travel in areas where Salmonella Typhi is endemic." [Wikipedia:Salmonellosis]

Others may cause the death of the piglets and sometimes, the mother may eat the piglets. It is estimated that 50% of piglet fatalities are due to the mother attacking, or unintentionally crushing, the newborn pre-weaned animals.Savaging behavior impacts yields from pig farming. Efforts to eliminate the behavior include additional care and attention for the mother pig. Aggressive behavior may be due to fear, discomfort, and unsanitary conditions. Control of the birthing process and human supervision are the best ways to prevent the mother from eating the young.Anecdotal reports indicate that once mother pigs have cannibalised their young, this may happen again.[citation needed] Therefore, one approach to reduce savinging is to avoid using mothers that have savaged their young for breeding. Alternatively, placing experienced sows next to first-time mother gilts may discourage savaging.[citation needed]Proper diet and nutrition decreases the likelihood of gilt cannibalism.[citation needed] Medication or hormones, such as mysoline, can also be given.Pigs will sometimes attack other animals, including humans."

Alternatively an insecticide may be used to kill the mites – or the two methods may be combined. The loose crusty scales may also be removed by soaking the afflicted bird's legs in soapy water mixed with diluted ammonia, and the encrusted areas scrubbed gently with a soft brush. Complete removal may take multiple treatments. Dropped scales may remain infectious for up to a month, and so pen, perches, and nesting areas may also be treated, or birds may be moved to different housing for several weeks."

Rao at Madras Veterinary College, Tamil Nadu, India, as a causative agent for \"snoring disease\" in cattle.The first intermediate host is a freshwater snail Indoplanorbis exustus that may be the sole natural intermediate host for Schistosoma nasale (and other two Schistosoma species) on the Indian sub-continent. Earlier, other snails are also implicated in transmission of Schistosoma nasale as its the first intermediate host and they include: Lymnaea luteola and Lymnaea acuminata but experimental work of Dutt and Srivastava (1962) conclusively proved Indoplanorbis exustus as the sole intermediate host of S. nasale.Schistosoma nasale inhabits blood vessels of the nasal mucosa and causes \"snoring disease\" in cattle. and remains symptomless in buffaloes though extruding its eggs in nasal discharge.The clinical symptoms in cattle include a cauliflower-like growth or granuloma in the nasal cavity, associated with a \"snoring\" sound and profuse mucopurulent dischargeTemplate:Rao 1933). In the endemic areas, there are some local cattle which remain negative for S. nasale eggs, others excrete eggs but without exhibiting symptoms, while a large number exhibit symptoms with presence of the eggs in nasal discharge (Agrawal MC 2012 Schistosomes and schistosomiasis in South Asia. Springer (India) Pvt Ltd, New Delhi). A different form of nasal schistosomiasis where local cattle are negative for Schistosoma nasale but local buffaloes carry it without showing any symptoms has been shown to exist at Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh; there, cross-bred cattle exhibit snoring disease symptoms with eggs in their nasal discharge (Banerjee PS and Agrawal MC 1991. Prevalence of Schistosoma nasale Rao 1933 at Jabalpur. Indian Journal of Animal Sciences 61:789-791). Anthiomaline was the drug of choice, but this leads to relapse of the symptoms after two months of the treatment. Praziquantel proved better than any other drug but at present it costs Rs 1500 per animal as treatment cost. Recently, Dr. M. C. Agrawal has successfully treated cases of nasal schistosomiasis by administering triclabendazole at a dosage of 20 mg/kg body weight which appears a better alternative looking to cost of the treatment. Nevertheless, there are all chances of killing susceptible blood flukes by these less effective drugs resulting in existence of more resistant schistosome population in future generations causing more problems (Agrawal 2012).schistosoma nasale eggs are boomerang or palaquine shaped."

It is non-tuberculated (Gupta and Agrawal 2002 Comparative scanning electron microscopy of some Indian schistosomes. Journal of Parasitology and Applied Biology 11 : 49-54).The first intermediate host is a freshwater snail Indoplanorbis exustus that may be the sole natural intermediate host for Schistosoma spindale (and other two Schistosoma species) on the Indian sub-continent. One snail can produce up to 7,000 cercariae in one day.The cercariae usually infect some hairy host (low host specificity) in shallow and muddy waters.The definitive hosts of Schistosoma spindale are (mainly) ruminants and Schistosoma spindale cause intestinal schistosomiasis of ruminants (Artiodactyla, Ruminantia). Surveillance for cattle schistosomiasis is generally inadequate and the literature is limited, but some idea of the problem can be gained from past small scale studies. For a diagnosis there is need to find eggs of Schistosoma spindale in feces. Surveys in Sri Lanka revealed prevalence of Schistosoma spindale of 31.2% (of 901 cattle), whilst in Bangladesh a similarly high prevalence of 36% has been reported. More recently, in Kerala South India, prevalences have been reported up to 57.3% in cattle, 50% in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and 4.7% in goats. The prevalence of Schistosoma spindale in the animals depend on the diagnostic test, employed. Thus, it was as low as 10-30% by faecal examination (again low if egg detection method is employed and high if hatching method is followed ) with as high as 80-95% by examining mesentery of the animals, for alive schistosomes, during post mortem (Agrawal MC 2012.Schistosomes and schistosomiasis in South Asia. Springer (India) Pvt, Ltd, New Delhi). Schistosoma spindale was found causing an outbreak in cattle in Maharashtra leading to heavy mortality with symptoms simulating to Rinder pest (Kulkarni HV,Rao SR and Chudhari PG 1954.

Symptoms may include: abdominal pains, diarrhea, bloody stool, or blood in the urine. In those who have been infected a long time, liver damage, kidney failure, infertility, or bladder cancer may occur. In children it may cause poor growth and learning difficulty.The disease is spread by contact with water that contains the parasites. These parasites are released from freshwater snails that have been infected. The disease is especially common among children in developing countries as they are more likely to play in infected water. Other high risk groups include farmers, fishermen, and people using infected water for their daily chores. Diagnosis is by finding the eggs of the parasite in a person's urine or stool. It can also be confirmed by finding antibodies against the disease in the blood.Methods to prevent the disease include improving access to clean water and reducing the number of snails. In areas where the disease is common entire groups may be treated all at once and yearly with the medication praziquantel. This is done to decrease the number of people infected and therefore decrease the spread of the disease. Praziquantel is also the treatment recommended by the World Health Organization for those who are known to be infected.Schistosomiasis affects almost 210 million people worldwide, and an estimated 12,000 to 200,000 people die from it a year. The disease is most commonly found in Africa, Asia and South America. Around 700 million people, in more than 70 countries, live in areas where the disease is common.

It appears to be transmitted by midges (Culicoides spp.) which are likely to have been most active in causing the infection in the northern hemisphere summer and autumn of 2011, with animals subsequently giving birth from late 2011. Schmallenberg virus falls in the Simbu serogroup of Orthobunyaviruses; as of January 2013, it is considered to be most closely related to the Sathuperi and Douglas viruses.The virus is named after Schmallenberg, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, from where the first definitive sample was derived. After Germany, it has also been detected in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Ireland, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Norway, Poland and Estonia.The virus has been recognised by the European Commission's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (German Research Institute for Animal Health). A risk assessment in December 2011 did not consider it likely to be a threat to human health, as other comparable viruses are not zoonotic.Immunity can possibly be acquired naturally against SBV. It is possible that the seasonality of the infection cycle would not entail a second epidemic circulation next year, due to the shortness of the viraemic period (about 4 to 6 days post exposure, longer in affected foetuses). Vaccination is a possible option for controlling the disease as a vaccine exists for the similar Akabane virus. In March 2012, scientists of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut first succeeded in producing an electron microscope image of the Schmallenberg virus." [Wikipedia:Schmallenberg_virus]

Symptoms present after exercise or excitement and last a few minutes. A goose-stepping gait and arched spine are often seen, and the dogs may turn somersaults as it runs. The symptoms usually resolve after ten minutes, but they may repeat several times in a day. The condition does progress as the dog ages. If the diagnosis is unsure, a dose of methysergide can be given. In affected dogs, this will block serotonin and increase the frequence and severity of the symptoms. Diazepam or acepromazine is used to control the symptoms of Scotty Cramp. Vitamin E may also be of some benefit.

Like other spongiform encephalopathies, scrapie is caused by a prion. Scrapie has been known since the 18th century (1732) and does not appear to be transmissible to humans.The name scrapie is derived from one of the clinical signs of the condition, wherein affected animals will compulsively scrape off their fleeces against rocks, trees or fences. The disease apparently causes an itching sensation in the animals. Other clinical signs include excessive lip smacking, altered gaits, and convulsive collapse.Scrapie is infectious and transmissible among similar[citation needed] animals, so one of the most common ways to contain it (since it is incurable) is to quarantine and destroy those affected. However, scrapie tends to persist in flocks and can also arise apparently spontaneously in flocks that have not previously had cases of the disease. The mechanism of transmission between animals and other aspects of the biology of the disease are only poorly understood and these are active areas of research. Recent studies suggest prions may be spread through urine and persist in the environment for decades.Scrapie usually affects sheep around three to five years of age. There appears to be the potential for transmission at birth and from contact with placental tissues. There is no evidence that scrapie is infectious to humans." [Wikipedia:Scrapie]

Spots are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. As scurvy advances, there can be open, suppurating wounds, loss of teeth, jaundice, fever, neuropathy and death.Scurvy was at one time common among sailors, pirates and others aboard ships at sea longer than perishable fruits and vegetables could be stored (subsisting instead only on cured and salted meats and dried grains) and by soldiers similarly deprived of these foods for extended periods. It was described by Hippocrates (c. 460 BC–c. 380 BC), and herbal cures for scurvy have been known in many native cultures since prehistory. Scurvy was one of the limiting factors of marine travel, often killing large numbers of the passengers and crew on long-distance voyages. This became a significant issue in Europe from the beginning of the modern era in the Age of Discovery in the 15th century, continuing to play a significant role through World War I in the 20th century.While today scurvy is known to be caused by a nutritional deficiency, until the isolation of vitamin C and direct evidence of its link to scurvy in 1932, numerous theories and treatments were proposed, often on little or no experimental data. This inconsistency is attributed to the lack of vitamin C as a distinct concept, an inability to reliably link different foods (notably present in fresh citrus, watercress, and organ meat) to scurvy. An additional concept required to understand scurvy was the degradation of vitamin C by exposure to air and copper and other transition metal salts such as those of iron, thus changing the links of foods to scurvy over time.Treatment by fresh food, particularly citrus fruit, was periodically implemented, as it had been since antiquity. However until the 1930s, treatment was inconsistent, with many ineffective treatments used into the 20th century. It was a Scottish surgeon in the Royal Navy, James Lind, who first proved it could be treated with citrus fruit in experiments he described in his 1753 book A Treatise of the Scurvy, though his advice was not implemented by the Royal Navy for several decades.In infants, scurvy is sometimes referred to as Barlow's disease, named after Sir Thomas Barlow, a British physician who described it. However, Barlow's disease may also refer to mitral valve prolapse. Other eponyms for scurvy include Moeller's disease and Cheadle's disease.Scurvy does not occur in most animals because they can synthesize their own vitamin C. However, humans and other higher primates (the simians - monkeys and apes - and tarsiers), guinea pigs, most or all bats, and some species of birds and fish lack an enzyme (L-gulonolactone oxidase) necessary for such synthesis and must obtain vitamin C through their diet. Vitamin C is widespread in plant tissues, with particularly high concentrations occurring in cruciferous vegetables, capsicum fruit including chilli and all colours of bell peppers, citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruits), and almost all fruits including culinary fruits like tomatoes. The fruit with the highest concentration of vitamin C is the Kakadu Plum with nearly 3000 mg per 100g. Cooking significantly reduces the concentration of ascorbic acid.Ascorbic acid has a number of centrally important roles in plants." [Wikipedia:Scurvy]

SeV is a member of the paramyxovirus subfamily Paramyxovirinae, genus Respirovirus, members of which primarily infect mammals.SeV is responsible for a highly transmissible respiratory tract infection in mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and occasionally pigs, with infection passing through both air and direct contact routes. The virus can be detected in mouse colonies worldwide, generally in suckling to young adult mice. Epizootic infections of mice are usually associated with a high mortality rate, while enzootic disease patterns suggest that the virus is latent and can be cleared over the course of a year. Sublethal exposure to SeV can promote long-lasting immunity to further lethal doses of SeV.A novel and well-recognized use for SeV is the fusion of eukaryotic cells, especially to produce hybridoma cells capable of manufacturing monoclonal antibodies in large quantities."

namespace: dbpedia
def: "Shar Pei fever is a condition seen in Shar Pei characterized by recurring fever and swelling of the hocks. It is similar to familial Mediterranean fever in humans. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be inherited. Shar Pei fever can result in renal and liver failure through accumulation of amyloid in those organs (amyloidosis).Affected Shar Pei have an elevated level of interleukin 6, and this leads to an accumulation of acute phase proteins in the body during the fevers. The acute phase proteins are broken down to form type AA amyloid, which deposits in the kidneys and less so in the liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract. This eventually leads to kidney or liver failure by the age of six years.The symptoms of Shar Pei fever include fever, swelling, and pain in the hocks that usually resolves within two days. The swelling in the hocks is easily recognizable--the hock will resemble a flaccid waterballoon, rather than stiff swelling following a sprain or break. The symptoms can be treated with NSAIDs such as carprofen. Kidney and liver failure cannot be treated except by the conventional manner usually used for those diseases. Prevention of amyloidosis is sometimes used in dogs with recurring episodes of Shar Pei fever. Colchicine and dimethyl sulfoxide are most commonly used. Dogs taking colchicine must be monitored closely for signs of bone marrow disease. The prognosis is guarded for Shar Pei that develop amyloidosis. Discuss the use of colchicine with your vet. It may not be the best solution, as it can have multiple side effects.FSF attacks can most often be linked to excess stress, both physical and emotional. These attacks usually accompany other illnesses, or stem from residual stress after extended periods of isolation or separation from the owner. The simplest treatment to slow the progression of the condition toward amyloidosis is to avoid the attacks altogether. This is usually possible by eliminating the dog's source of stress. Rest, along with treatment of any other illness, will facilitate the relief of an existing attack. Health maintenance will help to ensure that the attacks do not persist. It is important to remember that, as FSF is a genetic condition, if a dog has one attack, he will always be susceptible to another. Attacks may also occur due to something as simple as allergies, more frequent in certain months of the year.It is also worth noting, that with any fever the dog should be monitored to insure their temperature does not rise above 105 degrees. At that temperature several complications can occur. Aspirin and other NSAIDs should not be given at home, as they can have unintended side effects and can make it difficult to treat with other, safer NSAIDs such as Rimadyl. If the dog's temperature rises above 105, you should take it to an emergency vet. There are several things that can be done, one being the administration of Rimadyl to reduce the pain and fever. Fluids under the skin or intravenous may also be very helpful. Applying rubbing alcohol to the pads of the feet and giving cold water will make the dog temporarily more comfortable, but it will not help in the long term. The dog's internal 'thermostat' needs to be re-set to a normal temperature, and that can only be accomplished with medications and fluids." [Wikipedia:Shar_Pei_fever]

These tumors can become large enough that they interfere with the host’s ability to eat, eventually causing starvation.Shope papilloma virus provided the first mammalian model of a cancer caused by a virus. It takes its name from Dr. Richard E. Shope, who discovered it in the 1930s. Shope was able to isolate virus particles from tumors on captured animals and use these to inoculate domestic rabbits, which then developed similar tumors.The virus was sequenced in 1984, showing substantial sequence similarities to HPV1a. It has been used as a model for human papillomaviruses both before and after this discovery. The most visible example of this role is the HPV vaccine, which was developed based on and incorporating research done using the virus as a model. Similarly, it has been used to investigate antiviral therapies.The virus is also a possible source of myths about the jackalope, a rabbit with the antlers of an antelope, and related cryptids such as the wolpertinger. Stories and illustrations of horned rabbits appear in scientific treatises dating back many years, such as the Tableau encyclopédique et méthodique, from 1789." [Wikipedia:Shope_papilloma_virus]

The most likely route of transmission of HIV-1 to humans involves contact with the blood of chimps that are often hunted for bushmeat in Africa.Unlike HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in humans, SIV infections in their natural hosts appear in many cases to be non-pathogenic. Extensive studies in sooty mangabeys have established that SIVsmm infection does not cause any disease in these animals, despite high levels of circulating virus. However, if this virus infects an Asian or Indian rhesus macaque, the animal will develop simian AIDS (SAIDS). A recent study of SIVcpz in wild living chimpanzees suggests that infected chimpanzees experience an AIDS-like illness similar to HIV-1 infected humans. The later stages of SIV infection turn into SAIDS, much as HIV infection turns into AIDS." [Wikipedia:Simian_immunodeficiency_virus]

When H. corallasia divides, the daughter cells move to the leading edge of the dark band and produce a \"house\" called a lorica. To do this, they drill into the coral's limestone skeleton, killing the coral polyps in the process.A disease with very similar symptoms has been found in the Caribbean Sea, but has been given a different name as it is caused by a different species in the genus Halofolliculina and occurs in a different type of environment."

Since its isolation from an Amazon freshwater dolphin in the 1970s, S. iniae has emerged as a leading fish pathogen in aquaculture operations worldwide, resulting in over US$100M in annual losses. Since its discovery, S. iniae infections have been reported in at least 27 species of cultured or wild fish from around the world. Freshwater and saltwater fish including tilapia, red drum, hybrid striped bass, and rainbow trout are among those susceptible to infection by S. iniae. Infections in fish manifest as meningoencephalitis, skin lesions, and septicemia.S. iniae has occasionally produced infection in humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and inflammation of the skin, intervertebral discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S. iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococci species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics have been used to treat S. iniae infections." [Wikipedia:Streptococcus_iniae]

namespace: dbpedia
def: "Canine subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS) is an abnormal, congenital heart murmur caused by subaortic stenosis (SAS). There is a high incidence of this condition among Rottweiler dogs.There is very good evidence that it is heritable, passed on from generation to generation genetically. This genetic trait is what is called polygenic, so that the inheritance is complex. An animal might have the genes for SAS, yet have no actual sign of SAS. Also, an animal might have signs of subaortic stenosis, and yet offspring with signs of SAS may not be seen for a couple of generations. Any animal that has subaortic stenosis should not be bred, because they can definitely pass the defect on to future offspring. There is some controversy as to whether the parents of an animal with SAS should be bred again.Heart murmurs are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with one being very mild and six being very serious, with some animals dying before they reach this high stage due to a sudden leap in the grade or through long-term slowing down. Murmurs can exist due to a large number of heart problems (infection, trauma, anemia, etc.; some are innocent, with no cardiac pathology. Tests such as chest X-rays, echocardiography, and electro-cardiography can be performed to evaluate the severity of the situationAortic stenosis in the Rottweiler appears to be true subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS), similar to that in the Newfoundland dog, as opposed to the valvular form (seen more in boxer dogs) or the supravalvular form sometimes seen in people.The condition is usually detected during puppy visits to the veterinarian by hearing a heart murmur during physical examination. A heart murmur is the abnormal sound of blood rushing through one of the heart valves. Instead of just the heartbeat, a whistle of blood flow through a narrowed opening is heard. The puppy will most likely appear normal in all other respects. There is a possibility that the murmur may come and go, or it may develop slowly; this can be determined by frequent checks of a puppy's heart during its first few months. The chance for long-term survival of SAS is low.Puppies and dogs diagnosed with subaortic stenosis can suffer from heart failure and sudden death. If a dog with SAS develops heart failure, medications can be prescribed to alleviate the clinical signs (sudden/strong lethargicism, heavy panting continuously, rise in temperature etc.).The OFA has established a Congenital Heart Registry whose guidelines were established by veterinary cardiologists. A dog which auscultates normally at 12 months of age is considered to be free of congenital heart disease; upon confirmation of this, the OFA will issue a certificate."

name: sudden acquired retinal degeneration
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Sudden acquired retinal degeneration syndrome (SARDS) is a disease in dogs causing sudden blindness. It can occur in any breed, but female dogs may be predisposed. Approximately 4000 cases are seen in the United States annually.The cause of SARDS is considered to be idiopathic and the veterinary community is divided as to its cause, but the disease possibly involves autoimmune disease, toxins, elevations in adrenal sex hormones or Cushing's disease.Symptoms include sudden permanent blindness, but may occur more slowly over several days, weeks or months, dilated pupils. Pupillary light reflexes are usually reduced but present; the slow phase mediated by melanopsin in retinal ganglion cells is retained. Other symptoms commonly seen are similar to those seen with Cushing's disease and include increased water consumption and urination, weight gain, confusion, restlessness, behavioral changes and lethargy. These symptoms may develop over a few months preceding the onset of SARD. Despite similar symptoms and blood test results to Cushing's disease, evaluation of dogs with SARD did not reveal any tumors in the pituitary or adrenal glands. However, endocrine testing (i.e., Canine Adrenal Panel at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine Endocrinology Service) often shows elevations in adrenal sex hormones. Clinical signs and disease progression vary markedly among individual animals, depending on the number and type of hormones that are increased, the degree of hormone elevation, and the age of the dog. Autoimmune disease as a cause has also been called into question because of a lack of antiretinal autoantibodies in dogs with SARD in one study.Examination with an ophthalmoscope will initially show no changes, but in a few months atrophy of the retina will resemble the appearance of progressive retinal atrophy. Pathologically, there is a loss of the rod and cone cells followed by degeneration of other layers of the retina. The retinal degeneration appears to be related to apoptosis of these cells. SARD must be distinguished from other causes of sudden blindness that have no visible pathology, including retrobulbar optic neuritis, a tumor at the optic chiasm, or other central nervous system diseases. Electroretinography is useful to definitively diagnose SARD. Currently there is no approved treatment, although the use of intravenous immunoglobulin has been investigated due to similarities between SARD and human immune-mediated retinopathy.Endocrine testing by National Veterinary Diagnostic Services (the only laboratory that offers the endocrine-immune blood test developed by Alfred Plechner, DVM) revealed that some pets with SARDS had endocrine-immune abnormalities and physiological doses of cortisone and thyroid hormone were anecdotally shown to be beneficial to their overall health and vision. \"Adrenal exhaustion\" is a syndrome put forth by Ms. C. Levin, a lay person, who subscribes to the theories of Dr. Plechner. However, \"adrenal exhaustion\" (not to be confused with Addison's disease) is not recognized as a legitimate medical disorder in veterinary medicine and the condition has not been described in dogs (or cats). Moreover, this experimental hormone replacement therapy has not been approved or evaluated for efficacy and safety by the veterinary community, nor has it undergone scientific peer review in the mainstream veterinary literature.Some owners notice a more obvious \"eye shine\" in photographs due to the dilated pupils and retinal atrophy creating what is described as a \"hyper-reflective tapetum\".Additional information on SARDS may be found at this website http://www.sardsawareness.org which provides links to research carried out by Dr. Sinisa Grozdanic, D.V.M., Ph.D., Associate Professor of Comparative Ophthalmology at the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University, in Ames, Iowa. The website provides a link to a Powerpoint presentation summarizing the work of Dr. Grozdanic and his co-researchers This is another link to a news release describing Dr. Grozdanic's work: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/03/080304173310.htm Dr. Grozdanic has found that SARDS like symptoms may be related to a similar disorder which he calls Immune-Mediated Retinopathy, or IMR, which causes loss of function in retinal cells and, in some cases, blindness in canines. In SARDS cases there is permanent damage to retinal cells, but in IMR cases there is loss of function of the retinal cells which may be partially reversed by treatments developed by Dr. Grozdanic, and an affected dog's vision may be restored to a degree where the dog has functioning eyesight again. Not all dogs are candidates for his treatments, which may be contra-indicated by other underlying health disorders." [Wikipedia:Sudden_acquired_retinal_degeneration]

def: "Swimmer’s itch, also known as lake itch, duck itch, cercarial dermatitis, and schistosome cercarial dermatitis, is a short-term, immune reaction occurring in the skin of humans that have been infected by water-borne schistosomatidae. Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, commonly occur within hours of infection and do not generally last more than a week. A number of different flatworm parasites in the family Schistosomatidae are what cause swimmer’s itch. These parasites use both freshwater snails and vertebrates as hosts in their parasitic life cycles. Mostly waterfowl are used as the vertebrate host. During one of their life stages, the larvae of the parasite, cercariae, leave the water snails and swim freely in the freshwater, attempting to encounter water birds. These larvae can accidentally come into contact with the skin of a swimmer. The cercaria penetrates the skin and dies in the skin immediately. The cercariae cannot infect humans, but they cause an inflammatory immune reaction. This reaction causes initially mildly itchy spots on the skin. Within hours, these spots become raised papules which are intensely itchy. Each papule corresponds to the penetration site of a single parasite. The schistosomatidae that give rise to swimmer’s itch should not to be confused with those of the genus Schistosoma, which infect humans and cause the serious human disease schistosomiasis, or with larval stages of thimble jellyfish (Linuche unguiculata), which give rise to seabather's eruption. Seabather's eruption mostly occurs in salt water, on skin covered by clothing or hair, whereas swimmer's itch mostly occurs in freshwater, on uncovered skin.Since it was first described in Michigan in 1928, swimmer's itch has been reported from around the world. Some suggest incidence may be on the rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring." [Wikipedia:Swimmer's_itch]

Symptoms include papules and pustules on the skin of the abdomen. Characteristic lesions on the lower abdomen have dark hemorrhagic centers. Swinepox is transmitted by direct contact and by the pig louse, Hematopinus suis. Often the hooves go crusty due to the animals water content in its body being used for fighting the infection. This in serious Swine pox cases can cause malformed hoofs and damage the ability for the pig to walk properly. In some extremely rare cases, the genetics of the animal can be changed by this disease but go unnoticed in terms of physical symptoms; this, if contracted by breeding pigs is very threatening for the potential baby piglets to be born. Piglets born from parents that both have the severest strain of the disease will be born frequently with disfigurements such as a tail that is bulbous, and crooked snouts. The inside of the animal is also affected by the genetic strain by making the muscles and fat of the animal pus filled and also weakens the piglets organs overtime resulting in death."

Toxocariasis is often called visceral larva migrans (VLM). Depending on geographic location, degree of eosinophilia, eye and/or pulmonary signs the terms ocular larva migrans (OLM), Weingarten's disease, Frimodt-Møller's syndrome, and eosiniphilic pseudoleukemia are applied to toxocariasis. Other terms sometimes or rarely used include nematode ophthalmitis, toxocaral disease, toxocarose, and covert toxocariasis,). This zoonotic, helminthic infection is a major cause of blindness and may provoke rheumatic, neurologic, or asthmatic symptoms. Humans normally become infected by ingestion of embryonated eggs (each containing a fully developed larva, L2) from contaminated sources (soil, fresh or unwashed vegetables, or improperly cooked paratenic hosts).Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati are perhaps the most ubiquitous gastrointestinal worms (helminths) of domestic dogs and cats and foxes. There are many 'accidental' or paratenic hosts including humans, birds, pigs, rodents, goats, monkeys, and rabbits. In paratenic hosts the larvae never mature and remain at the L2 stage.There are three main syndromes: visceral larva migrans (VLM), which encompasses diseases associated with major organs; covert toxocariasis, which is a milder version of VLM; and ocular larva migrans (OLM), in which pathological effects on the host are restricted to the eye and the optic nerve."

def: "Toxoplasma gondii (tŏk'sə-plāz'mə gŏn'dē-ī') is an obligate, intracellular, parasitic protozoan that causes the disease toxoplasmosis.Found worldwide, T. gondii is capable of infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals. In humans, it is one of the most common parasites; serological studies estimate that up to a third of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with T. gondii, although infection rates differ significantly from country to country. Although mild, flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure, infection with T. gondii generally produces no symptoms in healthy human adults. However, in infants, HIV/AIDS patients, and others with weakened immunity, infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness (toxoplasmosis).Infection in humans and other warm-blooded animals can occur by consuming raw or undercooked meat containing T. gondii tissue cysts by ingesting water, soil, vegetables, or anything contaminated with oocysts shed in the feces of an infected animal from a blood transfusion or organ transplant or transplacental transmission from mother to fetus, particularly when T. gondii is contracted during pregnancyAlthough T. gondii can infect, be transmitted by, and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals, the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family (felids). Felids are therefore defined as the definitive hosts of T. gondii, with all other hosts defined as intermediate hosts.T. gondii has been shown to alter the behavior of infected rodents in ways thought to increase the rodents' chances of being preyed upon by cats. Because cats are the only hosts within which T. gondii can sexually reproduce to complete and begin its lifecycle, such behavioral manipulations are thought to be evolutionary adaptations to increase the parasite's reproductive success, in one of the manifestations the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins attributes to the \"extended phenotype\". Although numerous hypotheses exist and are being investigated, the mechanism of T. gondii–induced behavioral changes in rodents remains unknown.A number of studies have suggested subtle behavioral or personality changes may occur in infected humans, and infection with the parasite has recently been associated with a number of neurological disorders, particularly schizophrenia. However, evidence for causal relationships remains limited." [Wikipedia:Toxoplasma_gondii]

def: "Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. The parasite infects most genera of warm-blooded animals, including humans, but the primary host is the felid (cat) family. Animals are infected by eating infected meat, by ingestion of feces of a cat that has itself recently been infected, and by transmission from mother to fetus. Cats are the primary source of infection to human hosts, although contact with raw meat, especially lamb, is a more significant source of human infections in some countries. Fecal contamination of hands is a significant risk factor.Up to a third of the world's human population is estimated to carry a Toxoplasma infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes the overall seroprevalence in the United States as determined with specimens collected by the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) between 1999 and 2004 was found to be 10.8%, with seroprevalence among women of childbearing age (15 to 44 years) 11%. Another study placed seroprevalence in the US at 22.5%. The same study claimed a seroprevalence of 75% in El Salvador. Official assessment in Great Britain places the number of infections at about 350,000 a year.During the first few weeks after exposure, the infection typically causes a mild, flu-like illness or no illness. However, those with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS and pregnant women, may become seriously ill, and it can occasionally be fatal. The parasite can cause encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) and neurological diseases, and can affect the heart, liver, inner ears, and eyes (chorioretinitis). Recent research has also linked toxoplasmosis with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia. Numerous studies found a positive correlation between latent toxoplasmosis and suicidal behavior in humans.Charles Nicolle and Louis Manceaux first described the organism in 1908, after they observed the parasites in the blood, spleen, and liver of a North African rodent, Ctenodactylus gundi. The parasite was named Toxoplasma gondii, from the Greek words τόξον (toxon, \"arc\" or \"bow\") and πλάσμα (plasma, \"creature\"), and after the rodent, in 1909. In 1923, Janku reported parasitic cysts in the retina of an infant who had hydrocephalus, seizures, and unilateral microphthalmia. Wolf, Cowan, and Paige (1937–1939) determined these findings represented the syndrome of severe congenital T. gondii infection." [Wikipedia:Toxoplasmosis]

def: "Tracheal collapse in dogs is a condition characterized by incomplete formation or weakening of the cartilagenous rings of the trachea resulting in flattening of the trachea. It can be congenital or acquired, and extrathoracic or intrathoracic (inside or outside the thoracic cavity. Tracheal collapse is a dynamic condition. Collapse of the cervical trachea or extrathoracic (in the neck) occurs during inspiration; collapse of the thoracic trachea or intrathoracic (in the chest) occurs during expiration. Tracheal collapse is most commonly found in small dog breeds, including the Chihuahua, Pomeranian, Toy Poodle, Shih Tzu, Lhasa Apso, Maltese, Pug, and Yorkshire Terrier.Congenital tracheal collapse appears to be caused by a deficiency of normal components of tracheal ring cartilage like glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, calcium, and chondroitin. Acquired tracheal collapse can be caused by Cushing's syndrome, heart disease, and chronic respiratory disease and infection.Symptoms include a cough (often called a \"goose honk cough\" due to its sound), especially when the dog is excited. This cough is usually paroxysmal in nature. Other symptoms include exercise intolerance, respiratory distress, and gagging while eating or drinking. Tracheal collapse is easily seen on an x-ray as a narrowing of the tracheal lumen. Treatment for mild to moderate cases include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and antitussives. Medical treatment is successful in about 70 percent of tracheal collapse cases. Severe cases can be treated with surgical implantation of a tracheal stent (inside or outside of the trachea) or prosthetic rings. Extraluminal (outside the trachea) stenting is generally only used for tracheal collapse in the neck region. Intraluminal stenting has shown more promise for success with intrathoracic cases, especially using nitinol, a type of shape memory alloy composed of nickel and titanium. Potential problems include stent migration and fracture.Tracheal collapse has also been described in horses, both as a congenital condition and as a result of trauma. It is most commonly seen in the cervical trachea." [Wikipedia:Tracheal_collapse]

The majority of species are transmitted by blood-feeding invertebrates, but there are different mechanisms among the varying species. In an invertebrate host they are generally found in the intestine, but normally occupy the bloodstream or an intracellular environment in the mammalian host.Trypanosomes infect a variety of hosts and cause various diseases, including the fatal human diseases sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei, and Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi.The mitochondrial genome of the Trypanosoma, as well as of other kinetoplastids, known as the kinetoplast, is made up of a highly complex series of catenated circles and minicircles and requires a cohort of proteins for organisation during cell division."

The onset of symptoms only occurred after migration into freshwater. Lesions became quickly infected with overgrowths of Saprolegnia fungus giving the affected fish an appearance of being covered in slimy white pustules. The most severely affected fish frequently die before spawning.Although the worst effects of the disease were seen in the 1970s and 1980, even now large numbers of salmon will succumb to the disease after spawning.

Humans also can contract this disease. Healthy adults who become infected by the virus may experience flu-like symptoms, such as high fevers and headaches. People with weakened immune systems and the young and the elderly can become severely ill or die from this disease.The virus that causes VEE is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes that bite an infected animal and then bite and feed on another animal or human. The speed with which the disease spreads depends on the subtype of the VEE virus and the density of mosquito populations. Enzootic subtypes of VEE are diseases endemic to certain areas. Generally these serotypes do not spread to other localities. Enzootic subtypes are associated with the rodent-mosquito transmission cycle. These forms of the virus can cause human illness but generally do not affect equine health.Epizootic subtypes, on the other hand, can spread rapidly through large populations. These forms of the virus are highly pathogenic to equines and can also affect human health. Equines, rather than rodents, are the primary animal species that carry and spread the disease. Infected equines develop an enormous quantity of virus in their circulatory system. When a blood-feeding insect feeds on such animals, it picks up this virus and transmits it to other animals or humans. Although other animals, such as cattle, swine, and dogs, can become infected, they generally do not show signs of the disease or contribute to its spread.The virion is spherical and approximately 70 nm in diameter.

It is caused by infestation with the nematode Parafilaria bovicola. Transmission involves fly vectors of the genus Musca, which ingest microfilariae when feeding on the skin lesions. The disease has been reported in Bulgaria, France, Germany, Morocco, Sweden, Tunisia, and especially South Africa.In Germany, the nodules are known to develop on the upper side on the body. In Morocco, the haemorrhagic lesions are mainly seen on the belly, neck and forelimbs, where it can lead to a wide plages of subcutaneous necrosis, with swelling of the arm.Ivermectin is efficient for individual treatments of the illness. But surgical excision, although very haemorrhagic, is far more efficient.A similar disease, sometimes referred to as Cascado, occurs in Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia) and is caused by Stephanofilaria species."

Today it is still a major concern for many fish farms in Europe and is therefore being watched closely by the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases.It was first discovered in the US in 1988 among salmon returning from the Pacific in Washington State. This North American genotype was identified as a distinct, more marine-stable strain than the European genotype. VHS has since been found afflicting marine fish in the northeasternPacific Ocean, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea.

Although both virus types have been observed in lesions of diseased fish, each cell of the infected tissue is host to a specific virus.

def: "West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae. This flavivirus is found in temperate and tropical regions of the world. It was first identified in the West Nile subregion in the East African nation of Uganda in 1937. Prior to the mid-1990s, WNV disease occurred only sporadically and was considered a minor risk for humans, until an outbreak in Algeria in 1994, with cases of WNV-caused encephalitis, and the first large outbreak in Romania in 1996, with a high number of cases with neuroinvasive disease. WNV has now spread globally, with the first case in the Western Hemisphere being identified in New York City in 1999; over the next 5 years, the virus spread across the continental United States, north into Canada, and southward into the Caribbean Islands and Latin America. WNV also spread to Europe, beyond the Mediterranean Basin, and a new strain of the virus was identified in Italy in 2012. WNV is now considered to be an endemic pathogen in Africa, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, Europe and in the United States, which in 2012 has experienced one of its worst epidemics. In 2012, WNV killed 286 people in the United States, with the state of Texas being hard hit by this virus, making the year the deadliest on record for the United States.The main mode of WNV transmission is via various species of mosquitoes, which are the prime vector, with birds being the most commonly infected animal and serving as the prime reservoir host—especially passerines, which are of the largest order of birds, Passeriformes. WNV has been found in various species of ticks, but current research suggests they are not important vectors of the virus. WNV also infects various mammal species, including humans, and has been identified in reptilian species, including alligators and crocodiles, and also in amphibians. Not all animal species that are susceptible to WNV infection, including humans, and not all bird species develop sufficient viral levels to transmit the disease to uninfected mosquitoes, and are thus not considered major factors in WNV transmission.Approximately 80% of West Nile virus infections in humans are subclinical, which cause no symptoms. In the cases where symptoms do occur—termed West Nile fever in cases without neurological disease—the time from infection to the appearance of symptoms (incubation period) is typically between 2 and 15 days. Symptoms may include fever, headaches, fatigue, muscle pain or aches, malaise, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, myalgias and rash. Less than 1% of the cases are severe and result in neurological disease when the central nervous system is affected. People of advanced age, the very young, or those with immunosuppression, either medically induced, such as those taking immunosupressive drugs, or due to a pre-existing medical condition such as HIV infection, are most susceptible. The specific neurological diseases that may occur are West Nile encephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain, West Nile meningitis, which causes inflammation of the meninges, which are the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, West Nile meningoencephalitis, which causes inflammation of the brain and also the meninges surrounding it, and West Nile poliomyelitis—spinal cord inflammation, which results in a syndrome similar to polio, which may cause acute flaccid paralysis.Currently, no vaccine against WNV infection is available. The best method to reduce the rates of WNV infection is mosquito control on the part of municipalities, businesses and individual citizens to reduce breeding populations of mosquitoes in public, commercial and private areas via various means including eliminating standing pools of water where mosquitoes breed, such as in old tires, buckets, unused swimming pools, etc. On an individual basis, the use of personal protective measures to avoid being bitten by an infected mosquito, via the use of mosquito repellent, window screens, avoiding areas where mosquitoes are more prone to congregate, such as near marshes, areas with heavy vegetation etc., and being more vigilant from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active offers the best defense. In the event of being bitten by an infected mosquito, familiarity of the symptoms of WNV on the part of laypersons, physicians and allied health professionals affords the best chance of receiving timely medical treatment, which may aid in reducing associated possible complications and also appropriate palliative care."

It has rapidly spread, and as of 2013, the condition had been found in over 115 caves and mines ranging mostly throughout the Northeastern U.S. and as far south as Alabama and west to Missouri and into four Canadian provinces.It is believed that Pseudogymnoascus destructans (formerly Geomyces destructans) is the sole cause of the disease. Direct microscopy and culture analyses demonstrated that the skin of the WNS-affected bats is colonized by a psychrophilic fungus that is phylogenetically related to Geomyces spp., but with a conidial morphology distinct from characterized members of this genus. This report characterizes the cutaneous fungal infection associated with WNS. No obvious treatment or means of preventing transmission is known, and the mortality rate of some species has been observed at 95%.Due to the disease, the US Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) has called for a moratorium on caving activities in the affected areas and strongly recommends that any clothing or equipment used in such areas be decontaminated after each use.

It is very contagious, spreading to nearby coral.At the locations where white pox disease has been observed, it is estimated to have reduced the living tissue in elkhorn corals by 50-80%. In the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS), the losses of living coral are estimated to average 88%.

def: "Withering abalone syndrome is a disease of the abalone shellfish, primarily found in the black and red abalone species.First described in 1986, it is caused by the bacterium \"Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis\", which attacks the lining of the abalone's digestive tract, inhibiting the production of digestive enzymes. To prevent starvation, the abalone consumes its own body mass, causing its characteristic muscular \"foot\" to wither and atrophy. This impairs the abalone's ability to adhere to rocks, making it far more vulnerable to predation. Withered abalone not eaten by predators typically starve.For reasons not yet well understood, some abalone can be infected with the bacterium without developing the disease. It is believed, however, that changes in environmental conditions, such as warmer than normal water temperatures, may induce the disease in abalone that already harbor the bacterium. For this reason, the spread of the bacterium could lead to further declines in abalone populations, especially during El Niño events, when water temperatures rise.Once a valuable fishery, abalone in Southern and Central California have been decimated by commercial and sport fishing, and more recently by this disease. Some populations of black abalone have declined nearly 99 percent since the disease was first observed in the Channel Islands off Santa Barbara." [Wikipedia:Withering_abalone_syndrome]

This disease is much like Multiple Sclerosis in humans, and may have a rapid onset, though more often the onset is gradual. The hind legs are often affected first, and then the paralysis spreads to the front legs and other parts of the body. Sometimes the paralysis affects one side of the body, and your hedgehog will begin tipping over and unable to stay upright. A series of case studies revealed that the onset of symptoms in most cases occurs between the ages of 18 and 24 months, although this disease has also been known to strike both younger and older hedgehogs. Hedgehogs with WHS will often experience weight loss, due in part to their inability to get to their food dishes (much can be done to help this) and in the advance stages of this disease, they become completely immobilized. In the cases that were studied, death occurred between 6 weeks and 19 months after the onset of symptoms. This disease has not been seen in wild hedgehog populations."

name: yellow-band disease

def: "Yellow-band disease (similar to Yellow Blotch disease) is a disease that attacks colonies of coral at a time when coral is already under stress from pollution, overfishing, and climate change. It is characterized by large blotches or patches of bleached, yellowed tissue on Caribbean scleractinian corals.Yellow-band disease is a bacterial infection that spreads over coral, causing the discolored bands of pale-yellow or white lesions along the surface of an infected coral colony. The lesions are the locations where the bacteria have killed the coral’s symbiotic photosynthetic algae, called zooxanthellae which are a major energy source for the coral. This cellular damage and the loss of its major energy source cause the coral to starve, and usually cause coral death. There is evidence that global warming is causing the spread of this disease."

name: yellowhead disease
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Yellowhead disease (YHD) is a viral infection of shrimp and prawn, in particular of the giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), one of the two major species of farmed shrimp. The disease is highly lethal and contagious, killing shrimp quickly. Outbreaks of this disease have wiped out in a matter of days the entire populations of many shrimp farms that cultivated P. monodon, i.e. particularly Southeast Asian farms. In Thai, the disease is called Hua leung.The disease is caused by the yellowhead virus (YHV), a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus related to coronaviruses and arteriviruses. A closely related virus is the gill-associated virus (GAV), which is the type species of the genus Okavirus." [Wikipedia:Yellowhead_disease]

name: zamia staggers
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Zamia staggers is a fatal nervous disease affecting cattle where they browse on the leaves or fruit of cycads -- in particular, those of the genus Zamia (thus the name). It is characterised by irreversible paralysis of the hind legs because of the degeneration of the spinal cord. It is caused by the toxins cycasin and macrozamin, β-glycosides (the sugars of which are glucose and primeverose, respectively) of methylazoxymethanol (MAM), and which are found in all cycad genera. Following ingestion the sugar is removed by bacterial glycosidase in the gut, with the MAM being absorbed. The metabolized toxin produces tumours of the liver, kidney, intestine and brain after a latent period which may be a year or longer. The disease has been known in Australia since the 1860s and was the subject of a Queensland Government investigation during the 1890s." [Wikipedia:Zamia_staggers]

name: zoonosis
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Zoonosis /ˌzoʊ.əˈnoʊsɨs/ (also spelled zoönosis) describes the process whereby an infectious disease is transmitted between species (sometimes by a vector) from animals other than humans to humans or from humans to other animals (the latter is sometimes called reverse zoonosis or anthroponosis). In direct zoonosis the agent needs only one host for completion of its life cycle, without a significant change during transmission.In a systematic review of 1,415 pathogens known to infect humans, 61% were zoonotic. The emergence of a pathogen into a new host species is called disease invasion or \"disease emergence\".The emerging interdisciplinary field of conservation medicine, which integrates human and veterinary medicine, and environmental sciences, is largely concerned with zoonoses."

name: zygomycosis
namespace: dbpedia
def: "Zygomycosis is the broadest term to refer to infections caused by bread mold fungi of the zygomycota phylum. However, because zygomycota has been identified as polyphyletic, and is not included in modern fungal classification systems, the diseases that Zygomycosis can refer to are better called by their specific names: mucormycosis (after Mucorales), phycomycosis (after Phycomycetes) and basidiobolomycosis (after Basidiobolus). These rare yet serious and potentially life-threatening fungal infections, usually affect the face or oropharyngeal (nose/mouth) cavity. Zygomycosis type infections are most often caused by common fungi found in soil and decaying vegetation. While most individuals are exposed to the fungi on a regular basis, those with immune disorders (immunocompromised) are more prone to fungal infection. These types of infections are also common after natural disasters, such as tornadoes or earthquakes, where people have open wounds that have become filled with soil or vegetative matter.The condition may affect the gastrointestinal tract or the skin. In non-trauma cases, it usually begins in the nose and paranasal sinuses and is one of the most rapidly spreading fungal infections in humans. Common symptoms include thrombosis and tissue necrosis. Treatment consists of prompt and intensive antifungal drug therapy and surgery to remove the infected tissue. The prognosis varies vastly depending upon an individual patient's circumstances."
